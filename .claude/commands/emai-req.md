Read and analyze the current REQUIREMENTS.md file. Provide a concise summary of:

1. **Project status** — What percentage of features are implemented vs planned
2. **Recent changes** — What was most recently added/fixed (look at the latest sections and checkmarks)
3. **Open issues** — Run `gh issue list --state open --limit 20` to show current open GitHub issues
4. **Next priorities** — Based on issue labels and the requirements doc, recommend the top 3-5 next tasks

Always read the full REQUIREMENTS.md file before summarizing. Cross-reference with GitHub issues for accuracy.
