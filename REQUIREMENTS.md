---

## 6. Core Features

### 6.1 Integrations
- **Google Classroom** (Phase 1) - IMPLEMENTED
- **TeachAssist** (Phase 2)

### 6.2 AI Study Assistant (Phase 1) - IMPLEMENTED
- Generate study guides from assignment content
- Generate practice quizzes
- Generate flashcards
- Summarize teacher handouts
- Identify strengths and weaknesses
- **Confirmation dialogs**: All AI generation and destructive actions use custom styled confirmation modals (ConfirmModal component with useConfirm hook) instead of native browser dialogs, with danger variant for destructive operations like permanent delete
- **Robust JSON parsing**: AI responses wrapped in markdown code fences (` ```json ... ``` `) are automatically stripped before parsing, preventing "Failed to parse" errors
- **Non-blocking generation**: AI study material generation is fully non-blocking. Modal closes immediately after submission, a pulsing "Generating..." placeholder row appears in the study materials list, and the user can continue working. On success the placeholder is replaced with the real guide; on failure it shows an error with a dismiss button. Works from both Study Guides page and Parent Dashboard (queues generation and navigates to Study Guides page)

#### 6.2.1 Study Guide Storage & Management (Phase 1) - IMPLEMENTED

Persistent storage, organization, and lifecycle management for AI-generated study guides.

- **List & Browse**: Parents and students can view a full list of all their generated study guides, quizzes, and flashcards directly from their dashboards. Clicking any item opens the full study material for review. Students see their materials in the "Your Study Materials" section; parents see both "My Study Materials" and each linked child's study materials
- **Course Categorization**: Study guides are labeled under existing courses for organized browsing; students can filter guides by course using a dropdown filter
- **Configurable Storage Limits**: Maximum 100 study guides per student, 200 per parent. Limits are configurable via application settings (`STUDY_GUIDE_LIMIT_STUDENT`, `STUDY_GUIDE_LIMIT_PARENT`)
- **Version Control**: Regenerating a study guide for the same topic/assignment creates a new version linked to the original via `parent_guide_id`, preserving full history. Users can browse all versions of a guide
- **Duplicate Detection**: Before AI generation, the system checks for existing guides with matching content hash to avoid redundant API calls and save costs. Endpoint: `POST /api/study/check-duplicate`
- **Role-Based Visibility**:
  - **Students** see their own study guides plus any course-labeled guides shared within their enrolled courses
  - **Parents** see their own study guides plus all study guides belonging to their linked children
- **Deletion**: Users can delete their own study guides. Deleting a parent guide does not cascade to child versions
- **Course Assignment**: Any user can assign/reassign their study guides to a course via `PATCH /api/study/guides/{guide_id}`. A reusable `CourseAssignSelect` dropdown component is available on study guide view pages (StudyGuidePage, QuizPage, FlashcardsPage) and inline in dashboard study material lists
- **Ungrouped Guide Categorization**: Study guides without a `course_content_id` appear under "Ungrouped Study Guides" on the Study Guides page. Each ungrouped guide has a folder icon button ("Move to course") that opens a modal with a searchable course list. Users can type to filter courses or create a new course inline ("+Create" option appears when search text doesn't match any existing course). On move, the backend auto-creates a `CourseContent` entry via `ensure_course_and_content()` and assigns the guide, moving it into the grouped section

#### 6.2.2 Course Materials Restructure (Phase 1) - IMPLEMENTED

Restructure the Study Guides page to centre on **course materials** (course content items) rather than listing study guides directly. Each course material is the source document from which AI study tools (study guide, quiz, flashcards) are generated.

**Terminology**: The UI uses "Course Materials" as the parent concept. A Course Material is composed of:
- **Original Document** — the uploaded source file/text (stored as CourseContent)
- **Study Guide** — AI-generated markdown summary (`guide_type = "study_guide"`)
- **Quiz** — AI-generated practice questions (`guide_type = "quiz"`)
- **Flashcards** — AI-generated flashcard pairs (`guide_type = "flashcards"`)

All UI navigation and buttons use "Course Material(s)" terminology. The specific sub-type labels ("Study Guide", "Quiz", "Flashcards") are used only when referring to the individual generated output types (e.g., filter tabs, detail page tabs, generation buttons).

**GitHub Issues:** #194 (rename to Course Material)

**Navigation Flows:**

1. **Courses → Course → Course Materials** (existing, no change)
   - `/courses` — list all courses
   - `/courses/:id` — show course detail with its content items

2. **Course Materials (nav) → Course Materials List → Tabbed Detail**
   - `/course-materials` — lists all course materials across all courses, with filters (redirects from old `/study-guides` URL)
   - `/course-materials/:contentId` — tabbed detail view for a single course material

**Tabbed Detail View** (`/study-guides/:contentId`):
- **Tab 1: Original Document** — shows the source text/description of the course content item
- **Tab 2: Study Guide** — shows the generated study guide, or a "Generate Study Guide" button if none exists
- **Tab 3: Quiz** — shows the generated quiz, or a "Generate Quiz" button if none exists
- **Tab 4: Flashcards** — shows the generated flashcards, or a "Generate Flashcards" button if none exists

**Filtering:**
- Parents can filter by **child** (shows materials from that child's courses)
- All roles can filter by **course**

**Default Course ("My Materials"):**
- When a user creates study material (paste text or upload file) without selecting a course, the system auto-creates a personal default course named "My Materials" for that user (if it doesn't already exist)
- The uploaded/pasted content becomes a `CourseContent` item under the default course
- The generated study guide/quiz/flashcards are linked to that `CourseContent` via `course_content_id`
- Default course has `is_default = TRUE` on the Course model; one per user

**Data Model Changes:**
- `study_guides.course_content_id` — new nullable FK to `course_contents.id`, linking each study guide to its source material
- `courses.is_default` — new BOOLEAN column (default FALSE) to identify per-user default courses
- Backend helper: `get_or_create_default_course(user_id, db)` — returns the user's "My Materials" course, creating it if needed

**API Changes:**
- `GET /api/course-contents/` — new list endpoint across all courses (with optional `course_id` and `user_id` filters)
- `GET /api/study/guides?course_content_id=X` — filter study guides by course content
- `POST /api/study/generate` — accepts optional `course_content_id`; when no course selected, auto-creates default course + CourseContent
- `GET /api/courses/default` — get or create the user's default course

#### 6.2.3 AI Auto-Task Creation from Critical Dates (Phase 1.5)

When AI generates a study guide, quiz, or flashcards, the system extracts critical dates (exam dates, assignment due dates, review deadlines) from the AI response and automatically creates linked tasks.

**Approach: Prompt Enhancement (Zero Additional AI Cost)**
Instead of a secondary AI call, the existing generation prompts are enhanced to include a structured `CRITICAL_DATES` section in the response. This avoids any additional API costs.

**Flow:**
1. User generates a course material (study guide, quiz, or flashcards)
2. The AI generation prompt includes an instruction: "If any dates, deadlines, exams, or due dates are mentioned, include a `--- CRITICAL_DATES ---` section at the end with JSON array"
3. Backend parses the AI response to extract the `CRITICAL_DATES` section (if present)
4. The dates section is stripped from the stored/displayed content
5. For each extracted date, a task is auto-created:
   - **Title**: contextual (e.g., "Review for Biology Chapter 5 Exam", "Complete Algebra Homework")
   - **Due date**: extracted date
   - **Priority**: `high` for exams/tests, `medium` for homework/assignments
   - **Linked to**: the generated study guide + course
   - **Assigned to**: the student (if parent creates for child) or self
6. **Fallback task**: If no critical dates are found in the document, a "Review: {title}" task is created with today's date to ensure the user engages with the material
7. Created tasks are returned in the generation API response (`auto_created_tasks` array)
8. **Date prompt**: Frontend shows a modal after generation with auto-created tasks and date pickers, allowing the user to adjust action dates. If the user clicks "Skip", today's date is kept as the due date

**Date Extraction Format:**
- AI includes at end of response: `--- CRITICAL_DATES ---\n[{"date": "2026-03-15", "title": "Biology Exam", "priority": "high"}]`
- Backend helper `parse_critical_dates(content)` splits content and parses JSON
- If section is missing or malformed, silently skipped (no error to user)
- Handles relative dates via Python dateutil

**API Changes:**
- Generation endpoints (`/api/study/generate`, `/api/study/quiz/generate`, `/api/study/flashcards/generate`) return optional `auto_created_tasks` array in response
- No new endpoints needed — uses existing task creation logic internally

**GitHub Issues:** #195 (AI auto-task creation)

### 6.3 Parent-Student Registration & Linking (Phase 1)

ClassBridge is designed as a **parent-first platform**. Parents can manage their children's education without requiring school board integration or Google Classroom access. Student email is **optional** — parents can create students with just a name.

> **Note:** Registration no longer requires role selection. Users sign up with name/email/password only and select their role during a post-login onboarding flow. See §6.43 for the simplified registration & onboarding specification (#412, #413, #414).

#### Design Principles
- ClassBridge works **independently of school systems** — Google Classroom is an optional import source, not a requirement
- Students don't need to be attached to a teacher — parent-created courses have no teacher
- Student email is optional — students without email are fully managed by their parent
- No data is synced from Google Classroom by default — all syncs are manual and on-demand
- Parent-created courses are **private** to the parent's children only

#### Path 1: Parent-Created Student (Name Only, No Email Required)
- Parent creates a child from the Parent Dashboard with just a **full name**
- Email is optional — if no email, the student cannot log in independently (parent manages their account)
- If email is provided: system auto-creates an invite so the child can set their password and log in later
- Creates User (role=student, email=nullable) + Student record + `parent_students` join entry
- Endpoint: `POST /api/parent/children/create`

#### Path 2: Parent Links Existing Student by Email (with Auto-Create) - IMPLEMENTED
- A parent links to a student by email from the Parent Dashboard via `POST /api/parent/children/link`
- **If the student account exists:** Links immediately — creates entry in `parent_students` join table
- **If no account exists for that email:** System auto-creates a User (role=student) + Student record, generates an invite via the Unified Invite System (30-day expiry), and returns the invite link to the parent
- **If the email belongs to a non-student account:** Returns an error (cannot link to parent/teacher/admin accounts)
- Parent can optionally provide the child's full name; if omitted, the email prefix is used
- Multiple parents can link to the same student (e.g., mother, father, guardian)

#### Path 3: Self-Registered Student
- Student creates their own account at `/auth/register` with role=student
- No parent required — the platform works fully for independent students
- Student can optionally be linked to parent(s) later

#### Path 4: Google Classroom Discovery (On-Demand Import)
- Parent connects Google account and manually triggers "Search Google Classroom"
- System discovers students from the parent's Google Classroom courses
- Students not yet in ClassBridge are auto-created with their Google profile name
- Parent selects which students to link — nothing is automatic
- **Note:** This only works if the parent's Google account has Google Classroom courses (e.g., parent is also a teacher)

#### Student Email Policy
| Scenario | Email Required? | Student Can Log In? | Managed By |
|----------|----------------|---------------------|------------|
| Parent creates child with name only | No | No — parent manages | Parent |
| Parent creates child with email | Yes | Yes — via invite link | Parent + Student |
| Student self-registers | Yes | Yes — has password | Student |
| Google Classroom discovery | Yes (from Google) | Yes — via invite link | Parent + Student |

#### Email Identity Merging (MVP 1.5)
- Students may have both a **personal email** (used in MVP-1) and a **school email** (available when school board approves ClassBridge)
- When school board access becomes available, students can add their school email as a secondary identity
- Both emails resolve to the same student account
- Data model: `student_emails` table (student_id, email, email_type: personal/school, is_primary, verified_at)

#### Data Model
- **Many-to-many**: `parent_students` join table (parent_id, student_id, relationship_type, created_at)
- A student can have zero, one, or many parents
- A parent can have zero, one, or many students
- `relationship_type`: "mother", "father", "guardian", "other"
- `User.email` — **nullable for students only** (other roles still require email for login)

### Unified Invite System
Both student invites (from parent registration) and teacher invites (from shadow discovery) use a single `invites` table and endpoint:
- `invites` table: id, email, invite_type (student, teacher), token, expires_at, invited_by_user_id, metadata (JSON), accepted_at, created_at
- Single endpoint: `POST /api/auth/accept-invite` — resolves invite_type to create the appropriate User + role records
- Invite tokens expire after 7 days (students) or 30 days (teachers)

### 6.3.1 Course Management (Phase 1)

Courses in ClassBridge can be created by **parents, students, or teachers**. Courses do not require a teacher — parent-created courses exist for home learning. Google Classroom courses are imported on-demand only.

#### Who Can Create Courses
| Role | Can Create? | Visibility | teacher_id |
|------|------------|------------|------------|
| **Parent** | Yes | Private to parent's linked children only | NULL |
| **Student** | Yes | Visible to the student only | NULL |
| **Teacher** | Yes | Visible to enrolled students | Set to teacher's ID |

#### Course Assignment
- Parents can **assign courses to their linked children** via `POST /api/parent/children/{student_id}/courses`
- Students can **self-enroll** in courses via `POST /api/courses/{id}/enroll`
- Teachers can add students to their courses

#### Google Classroom Integration (On-Demand Only)
- **No data is synced from Google Classroom by default**
- Users must manually click "Import from Google Classroom" to pull courses
- Users select which courses to import — system does not auto-import all
- Synced courses are tagged with `google_classroom_id` for deduplication
- Background sync jobs are **disabled by default** — sync is portal-only
- Any data synced from Google Classroom or Gmail must be **manually selected and/or requested**

#### Course Data Model Changes
- `Course.teacher_id` — already nullable (no change needed)
- `Course.created_by_user_id` — **new field**: tracks who created the course (parent, student, or teacher)
- `Course.is_private` — **new field**: if true, only visible to creator's linked children (for parent-created courses)

### 6.3.2 Student-Teacher Linking (Phase 1) - IMPLEMENTED

Students link to teachers through **course enrollment**. This creates the relationship needed for parent-teacher messaging. Students don't need to be attached to a teacher — many courses have no teacher.

#### Relationship Model:
```
Parent ←→ Student (via parent_students join table)
Student ←→ Course (via student_courses join table)
Course ←→ Teacher (via course.teacher_id, OPTIONAL)
Parent ←→ Teacher (inferred: parent's child enrolled in teacher's course)
```

#### Manual Flow (No Google OAuth):
1. Parent registers and creates children (by name or email)
2. Parent creates courses and assigns them to children
3. Optionally: Teacher registers, creates course, student enrolls
4. Parent can message the teacher (if child is in a teacher's course)

### 6.4 Manual Course Content Upload (Phase 1) - PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED
- Upload or enter course content manually - IMPLEMENTED
- Supported inputs: PDF, Word, PPTX, text notes - IMPLEMENTED (images/OCR pending)
- Tag content to specific class or subject - IMPLEMENTED
- AI generates study materials from user-provided content - IMPLEMENTED
- Content privacy controls - pending
- Version history - pending
- GCS file storage - pending (#114)

### 6.4.1 Course Content Types with Reference Links (Phase 1) - IMPLEMENTED
- Structured content items attached to courses (notes, syllabus, labs, assignments, readings, resources, other)
- Each item has title, description, content type, reference URL, and optional Google Classroom URL
- Creator-only edit/delete authorization
- Color-coded content type badges
- Backend: `course_contents` table with `text_content` column for extracted document text, CRUD API at `/api/course-contents/`

### 6.4.2 Course Detail Page (Phase 1) - IMPLEMENTED
Dedicated page for viewing and managing a single course and its content:
- **Route:** `/courses/:id` — accessible to all authenticated roles
- **Course header** — Name, subject, description, privacy badge, Google Classroom badge, created date
- **Edit Course** — Creator/admin can edit name, subject, description via modal (`PATCH /api/courses/{id}`)
- **Course Content list** — Full CRUD (add, edit, delete) for content items
- **Upload Document** — Drag-and-drop or file picker, extracts text via `/api/study/upload/extract-text`, stores as course content with `text_content` field
- **Optional study material generation** — Checkbox + dropdown (study guide, quiz, or flashcards) when uploading a document
- **Generate Study Guide** — Button on each content item to generate study guide from its `text_content` or `description`
- **Navigation** — Courses page cards now navigate to detail page instead of inline expand
- **All roles** — Courses and Study Guides navigation visible to parent, student, teacher, and admin

### 6.5 Performance Analytics (Phase 2)
- Subject-level insights
- Trend analysis
- Weekly progress reports

### 6.6 Communication (Phase 1) - IMPLEMENTED
- Secure Parent <-> Teacher messaging
- Announcements
- Message history
- Notification system with in-app bell, email reminders, and preferences

### 6.7 Notes & Project Tracking (Phase 2)
- Notes management (per-course note-taking, rich text editor)
- Project tracking (group projects, milestones, task breakdown)
- Study planner (weekly study schedules, goal setting)

### 6.8 Central Document Repository (Phase 1)
- Store course materials
- Teacher handouts
- Student notes
- Organized by course/subject

### 6.9 Tutor Marketplace (Phase 4)
Extends the existing `teacher_type=private_tutor` — no new "Tutor" role. Private tutors gain marketplace features:
- Tutor profiles (skills, subjects, availability, hourly rates, ratings)
- Parent/student tutor search and discovery
- AI-powered tutor recommendations based on student needs
- Booking workflow (request, confirm, schedule)
- Payment integration

### 6.10 Teacher Email Monitoring (Phase 1) - IMPLEMENTED
- Monitor teacher emails via Gmail integration
- Monitor Google Classroom announcements
- AI-powered email summarization
- Paginated communication list with type filter and search
- Manual sync trigger and background sync job

### 6.11 Teacher & Private Tutor Platform (Phase 1)

ClassBridge supports two categories of teachers with distinct onboarding paths.

#### Teacher Types
- **School Teacher**: A teacher at a school whose courses appear via Google Classroom sync. May or may not be on EMAI.
- **Private Tutor**: An independent educator who registers on EMAI to teach their own courses, potentially using their own Google Classroom.

#### Platform Teachers (on EMAI)
- Teacher registers on EMAI → `User` (role=teacher) + `Teacher` record created automatically
- `Teacher` record stores: school_name, department, `teacher_type` (school_teacher, private_tutor), `is_platform_user=true`
- Can create and manage courses manually (without Google Classroom)
- Can connect multiple Google accounts (personal + school) to sync courses from different sources
- Full access to Teacher Dashboard: messaging, communications, course management, student rosters

#### Non-EMAI School Teachers (Shadow + Invite)
When a parent/student syncs Google Classroom and the course teacher is not on EMAI:
1. **Shadow record created**: `Teacher` record with `is_platform_user=false`, name/email from Google Classroom
2. **Invite email sent**: Teacher receives an invite to join ClassBridge
3. **If accepted**: Shadow record converts to full platform teacher (`is_platform_user=true`), teacher sets password and can log in
4. **If not accepted**: Teacher remains a read-only reference — name shown on courses, parents can still contact them externally

#### Multi-Google Account Support
- `teacher_google_accounts` table (teacher_id, google_email, google_id, access_token, refresh_token, account_label, is_primary)
- A platform teacher can link multiple Google accounts (e.g., personal Google for private tutoring + school Google for school courses)
- Each account syncs its own courses independently
- Replaces the current single `google_access_token`/`google_refresh_token` on `User` for teachers

#### Manual Course Creation
- Platform teachers can create courses without Google Classroom
- Add students to courses by email
- Create assignments manually
- Supports private tutors who don't use Google at all

#### Data Model
- `Teacher` model: user_id, school_name, department, teacher_type, is_platform_user, invite_token, invite_token_expires
- `teacher_google_accounts` table: teacher_id, google_email, google_id, access_token, refresh_token, account_label, is_primary, created_at

### 6.12 Teacher Course Management & Google Classroom Sync (Phase 1)

Teachers need to see and manage their courses. ClassBridge supports three course sources for teachers, enabling both school teachers and private tutors to manage all their courses in one place.

#### Course Sources

| Source | Description | Who Uses It |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| **Google Classroom Sync** | Import courses from a connected Google Classroom account | School teachers, private tutors with Google Classroom |
| **Manual Course Creation** | Create courses directly in EMAI without Google | Private tutors, teachers without Google Classroom |
| **Multi-Account Sync** | Sync courses from multiple Google accounts (personal + school) | Private tutors who teach at a school AND independently |

#### Google Classroom Sync for Teachers

When a teacher syncs courses from Google Classroom:
1. System fetches courses where the teacher is the **owner** (not just enrolled)
2. Each synced course is linked to the teacher's `Teacher` record via `teacher_id`
3. Assignments within those courses are also synced
4. Courses already synced (matched by `google_classroom_id`) are updated, not duplicated
5. Teacher can trigger a manual re-sync from their dashboard
6. Background job periodically syncs new courses/assignments (Phase 1.5)

#### Multi-Google Account Support (All Teachers)

Any teacher may need multiple Google accounts:
- **Private tutors**: Personal Google (e.g., `tutor@gmail.com`) for private tutoring courses + school Google (e.g., `tutor@school.edu`) for school courses
- **School teachers**: School Google account + a second school account if they teach at multiple schools, or a personal account for side tutoring

Each Google account may have different courses. ClassBridge supports linking multiple Google accounts:

- `teacher_google_accounts` table stores credentials per Google account
- Each account syncs its own courses independently
- Courses from all accounts appear together on the Teacher Dashboard
- Teacher can label accounts (e.g., "Personal", "Springfield High") for clarity
- Each account has its own OAuth tokens (access + refresh)
- One account is marked as primary (used for default operations)

#### Teacher Dashboard Course View

The Teacher Dashboard should show:
- All courses where `teacher_id` matches the current teacher
- Source badge: "Google Classroom" or "Manual" per course
- "Sync Courses" button (syncs from connected Google account)
- "Create Course" button (manual course creation)
- Student count per course
- Last synced timestamp

#### Data Flow

```
Teacher connects Google → Clicks "Sync Courses"
  → Backend fetches Google Classroom courses (teacherId filter)
  → Creates/updates Course records with teacher_id set
  → Returns synced course list
  → Dashboard refreshes and shows courses
```

#### API Changes Required

| Endpoint | Change |
|----------|--------|
| `POST /api/google/courses/sync` | Set `teacher_id` on synced courses when called by a teacher |
| `POST /api/teacher/courses` | Manual course creation (already planned, sets `teacher_id`) |
| `GET /api/courses/teaching` | Already works — queries by `teacher_id` |
| `GET /api/teacher/google-accounts` | Future: list linked Google accounts |
| `POST /api/teacher/google-accounts` | Future: link additional Google account |

### 6.13 Task Manager & Calendar (Phase 1)

A cross-role task/todo manager integrated into the calendar, available to all EMAI users. Any role can create tasks and assign them to related users. Provides a unified view of what's due, with role-aware data sources.

#### Task/Todo Manager
- Create, edit, complete, and delete tasks (personal or assigned to others)
- Task fields: title, description, due date, reminder date+time (time optional), priority (low, medium, high), category
- Tasks can optionally be assigned to another user (`assigned_to_user_id`) or linked to an assignment
- **Entity linking**: Tasks can be linked to a course (`course_id`), course content item (`course_content_id`), or study guide (`study_guide_id`). Create tasks directly from Study Guides page, Course Detail page, or per-content-item — link is pre-filled automatically. Linked entity name displayed as clickable badge on Tasks page — clicking navigates to the linked study guide, quiz, flashcards, or course detail page
- Quick-add from calendar date click, Day Detail Modal, dedicated Tasks page, Study Guides page (+Task button per guide), or Course Detail page (+Task button per content item)
- Filter by status (pending, completed), priority, date range, assignee, course
- Dedicated `/tasks` page for full task management (all roles). Clicking a task row navigates to the Task Detail Page (`/tasks/:id`); title highlights on hover to indicate clickability
- **Task Detail Page** (`/tasks/:id`): Dedicated page showing task info card (title, description, due date, priority, status, assignee, creator), toggle complete / delete actions, and linked resources section (study guide, course material, course links) with link/unlink UI — icon buttons to add new links, searchable modal with tabbed resource types, unlink (×) button on each resource card. `GET /api/tasks/{task_id}` endpoint with creator/assignee/parent authorization. `PATCH /api/tasks/{task_id}` supports linking via `course_id`, `course_content_id`, `study_guide_id` (send 0 to unlink) - IMPLEMENTED
- **Calendar task popover**: Clicking a task on the calendar shows a popover with a "See Task Details" button that navigates to the Task Detail Page

#### Cross-Role Task Assignment
Any user can create a task and assign it to a related user. Relationship verification is enforced server-side:

| Creator Role | Can Assign To | Relationship Check |
|-------------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Parent** | Linked children (students) | `parent_students` join table |
| **Teacher** | Students in their courses | `courses` + `student_courses` enrollment |
| **Student** | Linked parents | `parent_students` join table (reverse) |
| **Admin** | Self only (personal tasks) | N/A |

- Assigned tasks appear in both the creator's and assignee's task lists
- The assignee can view and complete assigned tasks but cannot edit or delete them
- The creator can edit, reassign, or delete tasks they created

#### Calendar Integration
- Tasks appear on the calendar alongside assignments, visually distinct (dashed left border, priority-based color vs. solid border with course color for assignments)
- Completed tasks show strikethrough text + muted opacity
- Clicking a calendar date opens a **Day Detail Modal** showing all assignments + tasks for that date
- Day Detail Modal supports: viewing items, adding new tasks, toggling completion, editing/deleting existing items
- Clicking a task on the calendar opens a popover; task title is clickable and navigates to Task Detail Page (`/tasks/:id`). Popover action buttons use icon buttons with title tooltips: clipboard (See Task Details), open book (Create Study Guide), graduation cap (Go to Course), books (View Study Guides)
- **Drag-and-drop rescheduling**: Users can drag task entries (chips in month view, cards in week/3-day view) to a different day to reschedule. Uses native HTML5 DnD with optimistic UI and rollback on failure. Only tasks are draggable — assignments remain fixed. Drop targets highlight with a blue dashed outline during drag.

#### Reminders
- Each task can have an optional reminder with date and time
- Time is optional — if omitted, reminder defaults to start of day (e.g., 8:00 AM)
- Reminders trigger in-app notifications (Phase 1) and optionally email (Phase 2)
- Reminder scheduling uses existing APScheduler infrastructure

#### Role-Aware Calendar Data Sources
| Role | Calendar Shows |
|------|---------------|
| **Student** | Assignment due dates + personal tasks + tasks assigned by parents/teachers |
| **Parent** | Children's assignment due dates + personal tasks + tasks assigned by children |
| **Teacher** | Course assignment deadlines + personal tasks + tasks assigned by students |
| **Admin** | Personal tasks/reminders only |

#### Google Calendar Integration (One-Way Push) — Phase 1.5
- Push EMAI reminders and deadlines to the user's Google Calendar
- Uses existing Google OAuth connection
- User can toggle which items sync to Google Calendar (per-task or global setting)
- `google_calendar_event_id` stored on tasks for update/delete sync

#### Data Model
- `tasks` table: id, created_by_user_id (FK→users.id), assigned_to_user_id (FK→users.id, nullable), title, description, due_date, reminder_at (nullable), is_completed, completed_at (nullable), priority (low/medium/high, default medium), category (nullable), course_id (nullable, FK→courses.id), course_content_id (nullable, FK→course_contents.id), study_guide_id (nullable, FK→study_guides.id), linked_assignment_id (nullable, FK→assignments.id), google_calendar_event_id (nullable), created_at, updated_at
- `created_by_user_id` — the user who created the task (any role)
- `assigned_to_user_id` — the user the task is assigned to (nullable = personal/self task)
- Assignment due dates queried from existing `assignments` table (not duplicated)
- Parent calendar aggregates children's assignments via `parent_students` + `student_courses` + `assignments`
- GET `/api/tasks/` returns tasks where user is creator OR assignee

### 6.14 Audit Logging (Phase 1) - IMPLEMENTED

Persistent audit log tracking sensitive actions for FERPA/PIPEDA compliance and security incident investigation.

#### What's Logged
| Action | Resource | Route |
|--------|----------|-------|
| login / login_failed | user | `auth.py` |
| create (register, accept-invite) | user | `auth.py` |
| create / delete | task | `tasks.py` |
| create / delete | study_guide | `study.py` |
| create / update | course | `courses.py` |
| create | message | `messages.py` |
| read (list children, child overview) | student / children | `parent.py` |
| sync | google_classroom | `google_classroom.py` |

#### Data Model
- `audit_logs` table: id, user_id (FK→users, nullable for failed logins), action (String(20)), resource_type (String(50)), resource_id (nullable), details (JSON text), ip_address (String(45)), user_agent (String(500)), created_at
- Indexes: (user_id, created_at), (resource_type, resource_id), (action, created_at)

#### Admin API
- `GET /api/admin/audit-logs` — paginated, filterable (user_id, action, resource_type, date_from, date_to, search). Admin only. Returns items with resolved user_name

#### Admin UI
- `/admin/audit-log` — table view with filters (action, resource type, search), pagination
- Linked from Admin Dashboard via "View Audit Log" button

#### Configuration
- `AUDIT_LOG_ENABLED` (default: true) — feature toggle
- `AUDIT_LOG_RETENTION_DAYS` (default: 90) — retention period for cleanup

#### Design
- Append-only: no update/delete API for audit entries
- Non-blocking: `log_action()` silently fails on error, never blocks requests
- Uses `String(20)` for action column (not Enum) for SQLite/PostgreSQL compatibility

### 6.15 Theme System & UI Appearance (Phase 1) - IMPLEMENTED

The platform supports three visual themes that users can switch between via a toggle button in the header.

#### Themes

| Theme | Description | Primary Accent | Status |
|-------|-------------|----------------|--------|
| Light (default) | Clean, bright UI | Teal (#49b8c0) | IMPLEMENTED |
| Dark (turbo.ai-inspired) | Deep dark with purple glow | Purple (#8b5cf6) / Cyan (#22d3ee) | IMPLEMENTED |
| Focus | Warm muted tones for study sessions | Sage (#5a9e8f) / Amber (#c47f3b) | IMPLEMENTED |

#### Architecture
- CSS custom properties (50+ variables) in `index.css` with per-theme overrides via `[data-theme]` attribute
- `ThemeContext.tsx` provides `useTheme()` hook with `theme`, `setTheme()`, `cycleTheme()`
- `ThemeToggle` component in header cycles through themes
- OS preference auto-detection via `prefers-color-scheme`
- Persisted to `localStorage` under `classbridge-theme`

#### Variable Categories
- Core palette (ink, surface, border)
- Accent colors (primary, warm, dark variants)
- Semantic colors (success, danger, warning, purple)
- Priority badges (high, medium, low)
- Content type badges (syllabus, labs, readings, resources, assignments)
- Role badges (parent, teacher, admin)
- Brand colors (Google)
- Shadows, radii, overlays, gradients

#### 6.15.1 Logo & Branding Assets (Phase 1.5)

The platform uses ClassBridge logo files in multiple locations with theme-aware rendering via transparent backgrounds.

**Logo Types:**

| Logo Type | File | Usage | Dimensions | Theme Support |
|-----------|------|-------|-----------|---------------|
| Auth Logo | `classbridge-logo.png` | Login, Register, ForgotPassword, ResetPassword, AcceptInvite pages | max-width: 200px | Transparent BG works for all themes |
| Header Icon | `logo-icon.png` | DashboardLayout header (all dashboards) | height: 48px | Transparent BG works for all themes |
| Favicon | `favicon.png`, `favicon-192.png`, `favicon.ico`, `favicon.svg` | Browser tab, PWA icon, bookmarks | 16x16, 32x32, 48x48, 192x192 | N/A |

**Theme Handling:**
- CSS uses `content: url()` to swap images based on `[data-theme]` attribute
- Current implementation swaps between `-logo.png` and `-logo-dark.png` variants
- New logo files have transparent backgrounds, so same file works for all themes (light/dark/focus)

**Implementation Details:**
- Auth logo: `Auth.css:21-30` (`.auth-logo` class with dark mode swap)
- Header icon: `Dashboard.css:25-34` (`.header-logo` class with dark mode swap)
- Favicon: `frontend/index.html:5` (`<link rel="icon">`)

**Asset Optimization:**
- Auth logo (v6.1): 196KB - optimized for clarity and detail
- Header icon (v7.1): 150KB - optimized for web performance
- Multiple favicon formats for cross-browser/device support (PNG, ICO, SVG)
- Transparent backgrounds work for both light and dark themes

**File Locations:**
- Source: `frontend/public/*.{png,ico,svg}`
- Build output: `frontend/dist/*.{png,ico,svg}` (copied during build)

**Status:** Phase 1.5 — IMPLEMENTED (#308, #309) ✅ (Feb 2026, commits 619e42b, d7bb5ce)

### 6.16 Layout Redesign (turbo.ai-inspired) — PLANNED

A layout overhaul inspired by modern SaaS dashboards (turbo.ai), addressing prototype user feedback.

GitHub Issues: #198, #199, #200

#### Planned Changes
- Persistent collapsible sidebar navigation (replacing hamburger slide-out)
- Glassmorphism card design with gradient borders
- Improved information density and visual hierarchy
- Simplified header (logo + search + notifications + avatar)
- Generous spacing and modern typography
- Mobile: sidebar converts to bottom nav or full-screen overlay

#### Status: Phase 1.5 — Not yet implemented

### 6.17 Global Search (Phase 1.5)

A unified search field in the DashboardLayout header that searches across the entire ClassBridge platform. Available to all roles (parent, student, teacher, admin).

**Searchable Entities:**

| Entity | Searchable Fields | Result Navigation |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Courses | name, description | `/courses/{id}` |
| Study Guides | title | `/study/guide/{id}`, `/study/quiz/{id}`, `/study/flashcards/{id}` |
| Tasks | title, description | `/tasks/{id}` |
| Course Content | title, description | `/study-guides/{id}` |

**Backend:**
- `GET /api/search?q=<query>&types=<csv>&limit=<n>` — unified search endpoint
- Case-insensitive `ilike()` matching (same pattern as admin user search)
- Results respect role-based access (parents see children's data, students see own, etc.)
- Returns results grouped by entity type with count per type
- Default: 5 results per type, minimum query length: 2 characters

**Data Model:** No new tables — queries existing Course, StudyGuide, Task, CourseContent tables.

**Frontend:**
- `GlobalSearch` component in DashboardLayout header (all roles)
- Debounced input (300ms), dropdown overlay with grouped results
- Type icons per category: courses (🎓), study guides (📖), tasks (📋), content (📄)
- Keyboard: Escape closes, Ctrl+K / Cmd+K to focus search
- Click result → navigate to detail page, click outside → close

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Create `app/schemas/search.py` (SearchResultItem, SearchResponse)
2. Create `app/api/routes/search.py` (GET /api/search)
3. Register router in `main.py`
4. Add `searchApi` to `frontend/src/api/client.ts`
5. Create `frontend/src/components/GlobalSearch.tsx` + `.css`
6. Integrate into `DashboardLayout.tsx` header

### 6.18 Mobile Support (Phase 1.5 + Phase 2+)

ClassBridge must be accessible and usable on all devices — phones, tablets, and desktops.

#### Phase 1.5: Mobile-Responsive Web (Current)
Make the existing web application fully responsive and touch-friendly.

**Status:** IN PROGRESS — 15 of 20 CSS files already have `@media` breakpoints (primary: `max-width: 600px`). Five files need breakpoints added: Auth.css, QuizPage.css, NotificationBell.css, TeacherDashboard.css, App.css.

**Requirements:**
- [ ] All pages render correctly at 320px–1440px viewport widths
- [ ] Collapsible sidebar navigation on mobile (hamburger menu)
- [ ] Full-screen modals on small screens
- [ ] Minimum 44px touch targets on all interactive elements
- [ ] Horizontal scroll for wide tables (admin user list, etc.)
- [ ] Touch-friendly calendar interactions (tap instead of drag-drop)
- [ ] Swipe gestures for flashcards
- [ ] No horizontal page overflow at any screen size
- [ ] Viewport meta tag configured correctly

**Implementation Notes:**
- Use existing CSS custom properties and `max-width: 600px` breakpoint pattern
- CSS-only solutions preferred over JavaScript for responsiveness
- Test with Chrome DevTools device emulation (iPhone SE, iPad, Galaxy S21)

**GitHub Issues:** #152 (mobile responsive web)

#### Phase 2+: Native Mobile Apps (Future)
Dedicated Android and iOS applications for enhanced mobile experience.

**Recommended Approach:** PWA first (Phase 2), then React Native (Phase 3) if needed.

**Future capabilities:**
- Native push notifications
- Offline access to study guides and flashcards
- Camera integration for scanning assignments/documents
- App store presence for discoverability
- Home screen install via PWA

**GitHub Issues:** #192 (native mobile apps)

### 6.19 AI Email Communication Agent (Phase 5)
- Compose messages inside ClassBridge
- AI formats and sends email to teacher
- AI-powered reply suggestions
- Searchable email archive

### 6.20 UI Polish & Resilience (Phase 1) - IMPLEMENTED

Frontend UX improvements for reliability, feedback, and loading experience.

**GitHub Issues:** #147 (ErrorBoundary), #148 (Toast), #150 (Skeletons)

#### Toast Notification System
- Global `ToastProvider` wraps the app in `App.tsx`
- `useToast()` hook returns `toast(message, type)` for any component
- Three types: `success` (green check), `error` (red x), `info` (blue i)
- Auto-dismiss: 3s for success/info, 5s for errors
- Click to dismiss, max 5 visible, animated entrance
- Mobile responsive (full-width at 480px)

#### React ErrorBoundary
- Class component wraps all routes in `App.tsx`
- Catches unhandled render errors gracefully
- Shows "Something went wrong" card with Try Again / Reload Page buttons
- In dev mode, displays error message for debugging

#### Loading Skeletons
- Reusable `Skeleton`, `PageSkeleton`, `CardSkeleton`, `ListSkeleton`, `DetailSkeleton` components
- Uses CSS shimmer animation (global `.skeleton` class in `index.css`)
- Replaces "Loading..." text across 16 pages: CoursesPage, TeacherDashboard, CourseDetailPage, AdminDashboard, StudyGuidesPage, CourseMaterialDetailPage, TaskDetailPage, ParentDashboard, TeacherCommsPage, AdminAuditLog, TasksPage, StudentDashboard, MessagesPage (conversation selection), QuizPage, FlashcardsPage, MyKidsPage

#### Task Due Date Filters
- Tasks page (`/tasks`) supports `?due=overdue|today|week` URL parameter
- New "Due" filter dropdown: All, Overdue, Due Today, This Week
- Parent Dashboard status cards (Overdue, Due Today) now navigate to `/tasks?due=overdue` and `/tasks?due=today`
- Dashboard overdue/due-today counts computed client-side from task data using local timezone (matches TasksPage filter logic exactly — fixes count mismatch caused by mixing assignment counts and UTC vs local time)
- Dashboard overdue/due-today counts adjust when a specific child is selected
- Filter state syncs with URL for shareable/bookmarkable links

#### Assignee Filter
- Tasks page has an "Assignee" dropdown filter populated from assignable users
- Parents can filter tasks to see only a specific child's tasks
- Filter works client-side alongside existing status, priority, and due filters

### 6.21 Collapsible Calendar (Phase 1) - IMPLEMENTED

Allow parents to collapse/expand the calendar section on the Parent Dashboard for more control over their view.

**GitHub Issue:** #207

**Implementation:**
- Calendar section has a collapse/expand toggle button (chevron icon)
- When collapsed, shows a compact bar with item count and expand button
- When expanded, shows the full calendar (default state)
- Collapse state persists via localStorage across sessions
- Calendar defaults to **expanded** on all screen sizes

### 6.22 Parent UX Simplification (Phase 1.5) — IMPLEMENTED

Simplify the parent experience based on prototype user feedback. The core problem: ClassBridge is organized by feature (Courses, Materials, Tasks) rather than by parent workflow ("What's going on with my kid?").

GitHub Issues: #201, #202, #203, #204, #205, #206

#### 6.22.1 Single Dashboard API Endpoint (#201)
Replace 5+ waterfall API calls with one `GET /api/parent/dashboard` that returns children, overdue counts, due-today items, unread messages, and per-child highlights.

**Status:** IMPLEMENTED ✅

#### 6.22.2 Status-First Dashboard (#202)
Replace calendar-dominated dashboard with status summary cards (overdue count, due today, unread messages) and per-child status cards above the calendar.

**Status:** IMPLEMENTED ✅

#### 6.22.3 One-Click Study Generation (#203)
Smart "Study" button that checks for existing material, generates with defaults if needed, and navigates directly — no modal required for the common case.

**Status:** IMPLEMENTED ✅

#### 6.22.4 Filter Cascade Fix (#204)
Fix course materials page filter behavior: reset course filter when child changes, scope course dropdown to selected child, show result counts.

**Status:** IMPLEMENTED ✅

#### 6.22.5 Modal Nesting Reduction (#205)
Eliminate modal-in-modal patterns. Study generation from day detail should navigate to a page instead of stacking modals.

**Status:** IMPLEMENTED ✅

#### 6.22.6 Simplified Parent Navigation (#206)
Consolidate parent nav from 5 items to 3: Home (status + calendar), My Kids (merged course/task/material view per child), Messages.

**Status:** PLANNED (Phase 2 — deferred)

### 6.23 Security Hardening (Phase 1) - IMPLEMENTED

Critical security vulnerabilities identified in the Feb 2026 risk audit and fixed:

#### 6.23.1 JWT Secret Key (#179)
- Removed hardcoded default `SECRET_KEY`; application crashes on startup in production if not set or uses a known weak value
- Development mode auto-generates a random 64-char key per process
- Production requires explicit `SECRET_KEY` via environment variable (stored in Google Secret Manager)

#### 6.23.2 Admin Self-Registration & Password Validation (#176)
- Blocked admin role from the public registration endpoint (only parent, student, teacher allowed)
- Added password strength validation: minimum 8 characters, must include uppercase, lowercase, digit, and special character
- Validation applied to both registration and invite acceptance flows

#### 6.23.3 CORS Hardening (#177)
- Replaced `allow_origins=["*"]` with explicit origin allowlist
- Development: `localhost:5173`, `localhost:8000`, configured `frontend_url`
- Production: only the configured `frontend_url` (Cloud Run service URL)
- Restricted allowed methods (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, OPTIONS) and headers (Authorization, Content-Type)

#### 6.23.4 Google OAuth Security (#178)
- Added cryptographic state parameter (CSRF protection) using `secrets.token_urlsafe(32)` with 10-minute TTL
- State tokens are consumed on callback (single-use)
- Removed Google access/refresh tokens from redirect URL parameters
- Google tokens stored server-side in temporary store during registration flow, resolved on user creation
- Error messages no longer leak internal exception details to the frontend

#### 6.23.5 RBAC Authorization Gaps (#181, #139)
- **Students route**: `list_students` restricted to ADMIN/TEACHER; teachers see only students in their courses; `get_student` scoped to admin/own/parent-child/teacher-course; `create_student` restricted to admin
- **Users route**: `get_user` restricted to own profile, admin, parent (linked children), teacher (course students)
- **Assignments route**: added `can_access_course()` checks on all CRUD; `create_assignment` restricted to course owner/teacher/admin; `list_assignments` scoped to accessible courses
- **Courses route**: `get_course` checks course access (enrollment/ownership/admin); `list_course_students` allows admin in addition to teacher
- **Course contents route**: `create`, `get`, and `list` (with course_id) verify course enrollment; update/delete allow admin in addition to creator
- **Study routes**: generation endpoints (study guide, quiz, flashcards) verify assignment course access before generating content
- Shared `can_access_course()` helper in `deps.py` checks admin/owner/public/teacher/enrolled/parent-child-enrolled

#### 6.23.6 Logging & Student Password Security (#182)
- Logging endpoint (`/api/logs/`) now requires authentication (Bearer token)
- Added input validation: max message length (2000 chars), max batch size (50 entries), valid level enum
- Frontend logger already sends auth token via Axios interceptor; unauthenticated errors silently skip server logging
- Parent-created student accounts use `UNUSABLE_PASSWORD_HASH` sentinel (`!INVITE_PENDING`) instead of empty string
- `verify_password()` explicitly rejects empty and sentinel hashes — no login possible without setting a real password via invite link

### 6.24 Multi-Role Support (Phase 1) - PARTIAL

Users can hold multiple roles simultaneously (e.g., a parent who is also a teacher, or an admin who is also a parent and student). The system uses an "Active Role" pattern where `role` is the current dashboard context and `roles` stores all held roles as a comma-separated string.

#### Phase A — IMPLEMENTED (#211)
- [x] **Backend: `roles` column** — `String(50)` comma-separated on User model with `has_role()`, `get_roles_list()`, `set_roles()` helpers
- [x] **Backend: Authorization** — `require_role()` and `can_access_course()` check ALL roles, not just active role
- [x] **Backend: Inline auth checks** — Updated 12 permission gates across 6 route files to use `has_role()`
- [x] **Backend: Registration** — New users get `roles` set to their registration role
- [x] **Backend: DB migration** — Auto-adds `roles` column and backfills from existing `role` at startup
- [x] **Backend: Switch-role endpoint** — `POST /api/users/me/switch-role` to change active dashboard
- [x] **Backend: UserResponse** — Includes `roles: list[str]` with field_validator for ORM compatibility
- [x] **Frontend: AuthContext** — `roles: string[]` on User, `switchRole()` function
- [x] **Frontend: ProtectedRoute** — Checks all roles for route access, not just active role
- [x] **Frontend: Role switcher** — Dropdown in DashboardLayout header (visible only with 2+ roles)

#### Phase B — IN PROGRESS
- [ ] **Admin role management UI** (#255) — Admin can add/remove roles for any user from the admin portal, with checkbox modal and auto-creation of profile records
- [x] **Auto-create profile records** (#256) — When adding teacher/student roles, auto-create Teacher/Student records if missing; preserve data on role removal (IMPLEMENTED - Feb 2026, commit 120e065)
- [x] **Multi-role registration** (#257) — Checkbox role selection during signup instead of single dropdown (IMPLEMENTED - Feb 2026, commit 120e065). **Note:** Role selection is being moved from registration to post-login onboarding (§6.43, #412-#414); multi-role selection will be supported in the onboarding flow instead
- [ ] **Admin as multi-role** — Admin users can simultaneously hold parent, teacher, and/or student roles, accessing all corresponding dashboards and features via the role switcher
- [ ] Merged data views (combined parent+teacher data on single dashboard)

### 6.25 Course Materials Lifecycle Management (Phase 1) - IMPLEMENTED

Course materials and study guides use soft-delete (archive) with retention policies, last-viewed tracking, and automatic study guide archival when source content changes.

#### Requirements
1. **Edit/delete icons on course materials list** — Each item in the StudyGuidesPage list has pencil (edit) and trash (archive) action icons
2. **Edit + delete on course materials detail page** — Document tab has "Edit Content" toggle for inline text editing; study guide tabs have "Archive" action
3. **Regeneration prompt after content edit** — When course material `text_content` is modified and linked study guides are archived, a regeneration prompt appears with buttons for Study Guide, Quiz, and Flashcards
4. **Auto-archive linked study guides** — When a course material's `text_content` field changes, all linked non-archived study guides (`StudyGuide.course_content_id == id`) are automatically archived. A toast notification shows: "Content updated. N linked study material(s) archived."
5. **Soft delete (archive)** — DELETE endpoints for both course materials and study guides set `archived_at` timestamp instead of hard-deleting
6. **Archive list with restore and permanent delete** — StudyGuidesPage has "Show Archive" toggle that loads archived course materials and study guides. Each archived item has restore (↺) and permanent delete (🗑) buttons
7. **On-access auto-archive after 1 year** — When a course material is accessed via GET, if `created_at` is more than 1 year ago and not already archived, it is automatically archived
8. **On-access permanent delete after 7 years** — When a course material is accessed via GET, if `last_viewed_at` is more than 7 years ago, the item and linked study guides are permanently deleted
9. **Last-viewed tracking** — `last_viewed_at` is updated on every GET access to a course material
10. **Toast notifications** — Success messages for archive, restore, delete, and content-save operations

#### Technical Implementation
- **Model changes**: `archived_at` column on `course_contents` and `study_guides` tables; `last_viewed_at` column on `course_contents`
- **Schema**: `CourseContentUpdateResponse` extends `CourseContentResponse` with `archived_guides_count: int`
- **Routes**: `PATCH /{id}/restore`, `DELETE /{id}/permanent` for both course contents and study guides; `include_archived` query param on list endpoints
- **Retention checks**: On-access only (no background job) — 1-year auto-archive, 7-year permanent delete
- **Frontend**: Archive toggle section, toast notifications, inline document editing, regeneration prompt on CourseMaterialDetailPage

#### Files Affected
- `app/models/course_content.py`, `app/models/study_guide.py` — new columns
- `app/schemas/course_content.py`, `app/schemas/study.py` — new response fields
- `app/api/routes/course_contents.py` — soft delete, restore, permanent delete, on-access checks
- `app/api/routes/study.py` — soft delete, restore, permanent delete, `include_archived` filter
- `main.py` — DB migration for new columns
- `frontend/src/api/client.ts` — new API methods and types
- `frontend/src/pages/StudyGuidesPage.tsx` — edit/delete icons, archive section
- `frontend/src/pages/CourseMaterialDetailPage.tsx` — document editing, regeneration prompt
- `frontend/src/pages/CourseDetailPage.tsx` — archive wording
- CSS files for archived row styles, toast, and regeneration prompt

---

### 6.26 Password Reset Flow (Phase 1) - IMPLEMENTED

Users can reset forgotten passwords via email-based JWT token flow.

**Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/auth/forgot-password` — accepts email, sends reset link (always returns 200, no user enumeration)
- `POST /api/auth/reset-password` — accepts token + new password, validates strength, updates hash

**Frontend:**
- `/forgot-password` — email form with success confirmation
- `/reset-password?token=...` — new password form with confirmation
- "Forgot password?" link on login page

**Security:**
- JWT reset tokens with 1-hour expiry and `type: "password_reset"`
- Rate limited: 3/min for forgot-password, 5/min for reset-password
- Password strength validation (8+ chars, upper, lower, digit, special)
- Audit logging for reset requests and completions

**Key files:**
- `app/core/security.py` — `create_password_reset_token()`, `decode_password_reset_token()`
- `app/api/routes/auth.py` — forgot-password, reset-password endpoints
- `app/templates/password_reset.html` — email template
- `frontend/src/pages/ForgotPasswordPage.tsx`, `ResetPasswordPage.tsx`

### 6.27 Message Email Notifications (Phase 1) - IMPLEMENTED

When a user receives a new in-app message, the system sends an email notification to the recipient (if they have `email_notifications` enabled). This ensures users don't miss important parent-teacher communications.

**Implementation:**
1. When a new message is sent (via `POST /api/messages/conversations/{id}/messages` or new conversation creation), an email is sent to the recipient
2. Respects the recipient's `email_notifications` preference (opt-out)
3. Creates an in-app notification (type: `MESSAGE`) for the recipient with sender name and message preview
4. Email includes sender name, message preview (truncated to 100 chars), and a link to the messages page
5. Dedup: skips duplicate notifications within a 5-minute window for the same sender (avoids spam on rapid-fire messages)
6. Email template matches ClassBridge branding (consistent with password_reset and task_reminder templates)

**Sub-tasks:**
- [x] Backend: Add email + notification dispatch to message send endpoints
- [x] Backend: Create message notification email template
- [x] Backend: Add dedup/batching logic to avoid email spam
- [x] Testing: Add tests for message email notifications (5 tests)

**Key files:**
- `app/api/routes/messages.py` — `_notify_message_recipient()` helper called from send/create endpoints
- `app/templates/message_notification.html` — branded email template
- `tests/test_messages.py` — `TestMessageNotifications` class with 5 tests

### 6.28 Manual Parent-to-Teacher Linking (Phase 1) - IMPLEMENTED

Parents can manually link their child to a teacher by email for direct messaging, bypassing the course enrollment requirement.

**Implementation:**
- `student_teachers` join table: student_id, teacher_user_id, teacher_name, teacher_email, added_by_user_id, created_at
- `POST /api/parent/children/{student_id}/teachers` — link teacher by email
- `GET /api/parent/children/{student_id}/teachers` — list linked teachers
- `DELETE /api/parent/children/{student_id}/teachers/{link_id}` — unlink teacher
- `GET /api/messages/recipients` updated to include directly-linked teachers (both parent→teacher and teacher→parent directions)
- Frontend: "Teachers" section in My Kids page with "Add Teacher" modal

**Relationship model:**
```
Existing: Parent → Child → Course → Teacher (inferred)
New:      Parent → Child → Teacher (direct via student_teachers)
```

**Key files:**
- `app/models/student.py` — `student_teachers` table
- `app/api/routes/parent.py` — CRUD endpoints
- `app/api/routes/messages.py` — updated `get_valid_recipients()`
- `frontend/src/pages/MyKidsPage.tsx` — Teachers section + Add Teacher modal

### 6.28.1 Teacher Linking Email Notifications (Phase 1) - IMPLEMENTED

Enhance the "Add Teacher" flow to send emails when a parent links a teacher to their child.

**Requirements:**
1. **Invitation email for unregistered teachers** (#234)
   - When teacher email is not in the system → create `Invite` record (type=TEACHER) + send branded invitation email
   - Email template: `app/templates/teacher_invite.html` with parent name, child name, accept link
   - On invite acceptance → backfill `teacher_user_id` on existing `student_teachers` rows
2. **Notification email for registered teachers** (#235)
   - When teacher email is in the system → send notification email + create in-app notification
   - Email template: `app/templates/teacher_linked_notification.html` with parent name, child name
   - In-app notification of type SYSTEM for the teacher

**Sub-tasks:**
- [x] Backend: Invitation email for unregistered teachers (#234)
- [x] Backend: Notification email for registered teachers (#235)
- [x] Email templates: `teacher_invite.html`, `teacher_linked_notification.html`
- [x] Backfill `teacher_user_id` on invite acceptance

### 6.29 Teacher Course Roster Management & Teacher Assignment (Phase 1) - IMPLEMENTED

Teachers can manage their course rosters (add/remove students), and courses allow assigning a teacher during or after creation.

**Requirements:**
1. **Teacher adds/removes students from courses** (#225) - IMPLEMENTED
   - `POST /api/courses/{course_id}/students` — add student by email (existing student → enroll + notification; unknown email → send invite with course context)
   - `DELETE /api/courses/{course_id}/students/{student_id}` — remove student
   - Auth: course teacher, admin, or course creator (`_require_course_manager`)

   - Frontend: optional "Teacher Email" field in course creation form (non-teacher roles) and edit modal
3. **Teacher invite via course context** (#227) - IMPLEMENTED
   - Unknown teacher/student email → create Invite with `metadata_json = {"course_id": id}`
   - On invite acceptance → auto-assign teacher to course / auto-enroll student

### 6.32 Manual Assignment Creation for Teachers (Phase 1) - IMPLEMENTED

Teachers can create, edit, and delete assignments for their courses without Google Classroom sync (#49).

**Requirements:**
1. **Assignment CRUD** — `POST/PUT/DELETE /api/assignments/`
   - Auth: course teacher, course creator, or admin (`_require_course_write`)
   - Create: validates course access, creates Assignment record
   - Update: partial update via `AssignmentUpdate` schema
   - Delete: hard delete with auth check
2. **Student notifications** — enrolled students receive in-app notification when new assignment posted
3. **Assignment list ordering** — sorted by due date (ascending, nulls last), then created_at descending
4. **Frontend: Assignments section on CourseDetailPage**
   - Displays all assignments with title, description, due date, max points
   - Overdue badge shown when due date has passed

- [x] Backend: Student notification on new assignment (#49)
- [x] Frontend: assignmentsApi CRUD methods (#49)
- [x] Frontend: Assignments section with create/edit/delete modals (#49)

### 6.33 Parent-Teacher-Course Visibility Flow (Phase 1) - IMPLEMENTED

Documents the end-to-end flow for parent-teacher-course visibility.

**Flow:**
1. **Parent assigns teacher to course** — Parent creates/edits a course with `teacher_email`
   - Teacher exists → assigned immediately (`teacher_id` set, `is_private = false`)
   - Teacher doesn't exist → invite sent with course context; on accept → auto-assigned
2. **Teacher manages roster** — Teacher adds student to course by email
   - Student exists → enrolled immediately (added to `student_courses`)
   - Student doesn't exist → invite sent with course context; on accept → auto-enrolled
3. **Parent sees course** — Parent's dashboard, CoursesPage, and MyKidsPage query courses via `student_courses` join on their children
   - Any course a child is enrolled in automatically appears to the parent
   - Teacher name/email displayed on course cards

**Visibility access rules (from `can_access_course`):**
- Admin → all courses
- Course creator → their courses
- Public courses → visible to all
- Assigned teacher → their courses
- Enrolled student → their courses
- Parent → courses their children are enrolled in

**Known gaps:**
- No parent notification when a teacher adds their child to a course (#238)
- No real-time dashboard refresh (requires page reload)

### 6.34 Course Enrollment (All Roles) (Phase 1) - PARTIAL

- [x] Backend: Add visibility check to self-enroll endpoint (#251) — rejects `is_private` courses
- [ ] Backend: Notify parent when teacher enrolls child (#238)

### 6.35 Teacher Invite & Notification System (Phase 1) - PARTIAL

Teachers should be able to invite parents and students to ClassBridge, resend invites on demand, and trigger proper notifications when enrolling students.

**Current state:**

| Flow | Email | In-App | Status |
|------|-------|--------|--------|
| Teacher adds new student to course | ✅ Invite email | — | IMPLEMENTED |
| Teacher adds existing student to course | ❌ | ✅ Notification | PARTIAL (#254) |
| Teacher invites parent | ✅ Invite email | ✅ TeacherDashboard modal | IMPLEMENTED (#252) |
| Resend any invite on demand | ❌ | ❌ | MISSING (#253) |

**Requirements:**
1. **Teacher invites parent to ClassBridge** (#252) — IMPLEMENTED
   - Added `PARENT` to `InviteType` enum
   - `POST /api/invites/invite-parent` — create invite + send email
   - New email template: `parent_invite.html`
   - On acceptance: creates Parent profile, auto-links to student via `metadata_json.student_id`
   - Frontend: "Invite Parent" card on TeacherDashboard with email + student selector modal
2. **Resend/re-invite on demand** (#253)
   - `POST /api/invites/{id}/resend` — refresh expiry, new token, resend email
   - `GET /api/invites/sent` — list invites sent by current user
   - Rate limit: max 1 resend per hour
   - Frontend: "Sent Invites" section with resend button
3. **Email notification on existing student enrollment** (#254)
   - When teacher enrolls existing student in course, send email (not just in-app notification)
   - New template: `student_enrolled_notification.html`

- [ ] Backend: List sent invites endpoint (#253)
- [ ] Frontend: Sent invites dashboard with resend button (#253)
- [ ] Backend: Email notification on existing student enrollment (#254)

### 6.36 Security Hardening Phase 2 (Phase 1) - IMPLEMENTED

Additional security improvements beyond the initial §6.23 risk audit fixes:

#### 6.36.1 Rate Limiting (#140)
- Added `slowapi` rate limiting to authentication endpoints (5/min login, 3/min register)
- AI generation endpoints rate-limited (10/min per user)
- File upload endpoints rate-limited (20/min per user)
- Rate limit headers returned in responses (X-RateLimit-Limit, X-RateLimit-Remaining)

#### 6.36.2 Security Headers (#141)
- Added security middleware with HSTS (`Strict-Transport-Security`), CSP (`Content-Security-Policy`), `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `X-XSS-Protection`, `Referrer-Policy`
- Headers applied globally via FastAPI middleware

#### 6.36.3 LIKE Pattern Injection Fix (#184)
- Escaped `%` and `_` wildcards in user-supplied search terms before passing to SQL LIKE clauses
- Applied to global search, study guide search, and course content search endpoints

### 6.37 Task Reminders (Phase 1) - IMPLEMENTED

Daily background job that sends in-app notifications for upcoming task due dates (#112).

**Implementation:**
- **Background job:** APScheduler job runs daily at 8:00 AM, checks tasks with due dates 1 or 3 days away
- **User preference:** `task_reminder_days` column on User model (default `"1,3"`) — comma-separated days before due date to notify
- **Notification type:** `TASK_DUE` added to `NotificationType` enum
- **Scope:** Sends to task creator and assigned user (deduped if same person)
- **Skips:** Already-completed tasks, tasks with no due date, tasks where reminder already sent (dedup via title+link matching)

**Files:**
- `app/jobs/task_reminders.py` — reminder job logic
- `app/models/user.py` — `task_reminder_days` column
- `app/models/notification.py` — `TASK_DUE` enum value
- `main.py` — APScheduler registration + DB migration for new column

### 6.38 Infrastructure & Reliability (Phase 1) - IMPLEMENTED

Cross-cutting infrastructure improvements for email delivery, auth, UX, testing, and mobile support.

#### 6.38.1 Email Delivery (#213-#217)
- Fixed SendGrid delivery: use synchronous `sg.send()` calls from synchronous FastAPI endpoints (async `SendGridAPIClientAsync` caused silent failures)
- Added Gmail SMTP fallback when SendGrid API key is unavailable or fails
- Parent invite emails now sent automatically when parent creates or links a child
- SMTP environment secrets added to Cloud Run deployment workflow

#### 6.38.2 JWT Token Refresh (#149)
- Added `POST /api/auth/refresh` endpoint that accepts a refresh token and returns new access + refresh tokens
- Refresh tokens have 30-day expiry (vs 24-hour access tokens)
- Frontend Axios interceptor auto-refreshes on 401 responses before retrying the failed request
- Refresh token stored in localStorage alongside access token

#### 6.38.3 Loading Skeletons (#150, #218)
- Replaced text "Loading..." states with animated skeleton screens
- `PageSkeleton` and `ListSkeleton` reusable components in `components/Skeleton.tsx`
- Applied to: StudentDashboard, MessagesPage, QuizPage, FlashcardsPage, CourseDetailPage, MyKidsPage

#### 6.38.4 Mobile Responsive CSS (#152)
- Added CSS breakpoints (`@media (max-width: 768px)` and `(max-width: 480px)`) to 5+ CSS files
- Responsive layout for DashboardLayout, CalendarSection, TasksPage, CoursesPage, MessagesPage
- Touch-friendly tap targets (min 44px), stacked layouts on small screens

#### 6.38.5 Backend Test Expansion (#155)
- Expanded `pytest` route tests from ~220 to ~288+ tests
- Added test coverage for: messages (send, list, conversations), notifications (list, mark read), study guides (generate, list), Google integration endpoints, admin routes, invite acceptance flow

### 6.39 Bug Fixes & Ad-hoc Improvements (Feb 11-12, 2026)

Defect fixes and ad-hoc improvements made during this development sprint:

| Fix | Description | Commit |
|-----|-------------|--------|
| Google OAuth double login | OAuth callback redirect required user to log in again; fixed to auto-set token | `9a317a1` |
| Password reset crash | `audit_logs.action` column was VARCHAR(20), too short for `"password_reset_request"` → widened to VARCHAR(50) | `7433746` |
| Role switcher not appearing | Local SQLite missing `task_reminder_days` column caused `/me` endpoint to crash silently; frontend never received `roles` array | `12b8d31` |
| Admin promotion | One-time migration to set `theepang@gmail.com` as admin+teacher in all environments | `12b8d31` |
| CSS variable mismatches | MyKidsPage.css used undefined CSS variables (`--card-bg`, `--border-color`, etc.) instead of design system vars (`--color-surface`, `--color-border`, etc.) | `29635f9` |
| Dashboard count mismatch (#208) | Overdue/due-today counts on parent dashboard didn't match TasksPage totals; fixed to use same query logic | `078545a` |
| Dashboard count child filter (#208) | Overdue/due-today counts didn't respond to child filter selection | `6376d0e` |
| Assignee filter (#209) | Added assignee dropdown filter to TasksPage for filtering tasks by student | `9677314` |
| Calendar default expanded (#207) | Calendar section defaulted to collapsed on some screen sizes; fixed to always start expanded | `4369eb5` |
| Task inline edit (#210) | Added inline edit mode to Task Detail page — edit button toggles card into form with all fields | `ba3cae8` |
| Inspiration messages Docker | `data/` directory not included in Docker image; added COPY directive and handled admin role in inspiration API | `a5b2f5d` |
| TypeScript build fix | Added `refresh_token` to `acceptInvite` return type and `loginWithToken` signature | `95a9618` |

### 6.40 Admin Messaging: Broadcast & Individual (Phase 1)

Admin users can send messages to all platform users (broadcast) or to individual users. All recipients with a valid email address will also receive the message via email.

**Backend:**
- **Broadcast endpoint:** `POST /api/admin/broadcast` — Admin-only. Accepts `subject` and `body` (HTML-safe). Creates an in-app notification for every active user and sends an email to all users with a non-null email address. Returns count of notifications created and emails sent.
- **Individual message endpoint:** `POST /api/admin/users/{user_id}/message` — Admin-only. Accepts `subject` and `body`. Creates an in-app notification for the target user and sends an email if the user has an email address.
- **Broadcast history:** `GET /api/admin/broadcasts` — List past broadcasts with timestamp, subject, recipient count.
- Email is sent asynchronously (background) to avoid request timeout for large user bases.
- Uses existing `send_email_sync` from `email_service.py` with the configured `FROM_EMAIL` (clazzbridge@gmail.com).
- Audit log entries created for both broadcast and individual messages.

**Frontend (AdminDashboard):**
- **"Send Broadcast" button** on Admin Dashboard — opens a modal with subject + rich-text body fields, preview, and "Send to All Users" confirmation.
- **"Send Message" action** per user row in the user management table — opens a modal to compose a message to that specific user.
- **Broadcast history section** — collapsible section showing past broadcasts with date, subject, and recipient count.
- Success/error toast notifications after send.

**Sub-tasks:**
- [x] Backend: Broadcast endpoint with email delivery (#258)
- [x] Backend: Individual admin-to-user message endpoint (#259)
- [x] Backend: Broadcast history endpoint (#258)
- [x] Frontend: Broadcast modal on Admin Dashboard (#258)
- [x] Frontend: Individual message modal in user table (#259)

### 6.41 Inspirational Messages in Emails (Phase 1)

All outgoing emails from ClassBridge should include a role-based inspirational message (from the existing `InspirationMessage` system) as a footer/tagline. The message is selected based on the **recipient's role** and rotated randomly.

**Backend:**
- Update `send_email_sync()` (or individual callers) to accept an optional `recipient_role` parameter.
- When `recipient_role` is provided, query a random active `InspirationMessage` for that role using the existing `get_random_message(db, role)` service.
- Inject the inspirational quote into the email HTML as a styled footer block (italic quote with optional author attribution).
- Applies to **all** email types: message notifications, broadcast, individual admin messages, password reset, assignment reminders, task reminders, invite emails, teacher linked notifications, and student enrollment notifications.
- If no inspirational message is found for the role, omit the section gracefully.

**Email template update:**
- Add a shared inspirational footer block to all email templates (or inject programmatically before the closing `</body>` tag):
  ```html
  <tr>
    <td style="padding: 16px 32px; text-align: center;">
      <p style="color: #999; font-size: 13px; font-style: italic; margin: 0;">
        "{{inspiration_text}}"
        {{#if inspiration_author}} — {{inspiration_author}}{{/if}}
      </p>
    </td>
  </tr>
  ```

**Sub-tasks:**
- [ ] Backend: Add inspiration message injection to email service (#260)
- [ ] Templates: Update all 8+ email templates with inspiration footer (#260)

### 6.42 Admin Messaging Improvements: Notification Modal, User-to-Admin Messaging (Phase 1)

Enhance the admin messaging system so notifications open in a popup modal, all users can see admin messages in the Messages page, and any user can send a message to the admin team with email notification to all admins.

**A. Notification Click → Popup Modal (#261)**

When a user clicks on a notification (in the NotificationBell dropdown), the full message should open in a popup modal overlay instead of expanding inline or navigating away.

- **Frontend (NotificationBell):** Clicking any notification opens a centered modal showing:
  - Notification title (bold header)
  - Full notification content (body text, no truncation)
  - Timestamp
  - "Close" button and click-outside-to-dismiss
  - If notification has a `link`, show a "Go to…" action button in the modal footer
- **Marks as read** on open (existing behavior preserved)
- **CSS:** Uses shared `.modal-overlay` / `.modal` pattern from `Dashboard.css`

**B. Messages Page: Show All Admin Messages (#262)**

When any user opens the Messages page, they must see conversations from all admin users — not just teachers/parents they have explicit relationships with.

- **Backend (`messages.py`):** Update `list_conversations` to include conversations where the other participant is an admin user. Currently conversations are filtered only by participant ID match — this already works since admin messages now create Conversation records. No query change needed if conversations are created correctly.
- **Backend (`messages.py`):** Update `get_valid_recipients` to include admin users in the recipient list for all roles — so users can initiate conversations with admins from the "New Conversation" modal.
- **Frontend (MessagesPage):** No structural changes — admin conversations will appear naturally in the list. Admin users should display with an "Admin" badge or label in the conversation list for clarity.

**C. Any User Can Message Admin (#263)**

Any authenticated user (parent, student, teacher) can send a message to any admin. All admin users receive the message in their Messages page AND receive an email notification.

- **Backend (`messages.py`):**
  - Update `get_valid_recipients` to always include all admin users as valid recipients for every authenticated user (regardless of role or relationships).
  - When a message is sent to an admin, also deliver the message (as a new Conversation or appended message) to **all other admin users** and send them email notifications.
  - New helper: `_notify_all_admins(db, sender, message_content, conversation_id)` — creates notifications and sends emails to all admin users except the sender.
- **Backend (email):** Use existing `send_email_sync` for individual admin emails, or `send_emails_batch` if notifying multiple admins.
- **Frontend (MessagesPage):** Admin users appear in the recipient list with an "Admin" badge. Selecting any admin as recipient sends to all admins.

**Sub-tasks:**
- [ ] Frontend: Notification click opens popup modal (#261)
- [ ] Backend + Frontend: Show admin messages in Messages page (#262)
- [ ] Backend + Frontend: User-to-admin messaging with email to all admins (#263)

### 6.43 Simplified Registration & Post-Login Onboarding (Phase 1)

Simplify the registration flow to reduce friction and reinforce ClassBridge as a **parent-first platform**. Role selection moves from the registration form to a post-login onboarding screen.

**GitHub Issues:** #412 (simplified registration), #413 (onboarding UI), #414 (backend onboarding endpoint)

#### Current State (Before)
- Registration form collects: name, email, password, role checkboxes (Parent/Student/Teacher), teacher type dropdown
- Roles are required at registration — `ensure_profile_records()` runs immediately
- Users must understand platform roles before signing up

#### New Flow (After)

```
1. REGISTER  →  Name, Email, Password (no role selection)
2. AUTO-LOGIN
3. ONBOARDING SCREEN  →  "How will you use ClassBridge?"
     [🏠 Parent / Guardian]    ← Prominent, recommended (parent-first)
     [📚 Teacher]
     [🎓 Student]
   If Teacher selected  →  "What type of teacher?"
     [School Teacher]  — "I teach at a school"
     [Private Tutor]   — "I teach independently"
4. REDIRECT  →  Role-specific dashboard
```

#### Design Principles
- **Parent-first**: Parent option is visually prominent (first position, highlighted/recommended badge)
- **Low-friction signup**: Only 4 fields at registration (name, email, password, confirm password)
- **Deferred role assignment**: User record created without a role; role set during onboarding
- **Multi-role support**: Onboarding allows selecting multiple roles (e.g., parent + teacher)
- **Teacher types**: School Teacher and Private Tutor — selected only when Teacher role is chosen
- **Not skippable**: Role is required to access any dashboard; users are redirected to onboarding until complete

#### Backend Changes

**Registration (`POST /api/auth/register`):**
- `roles` and `teacher_type` become optional (backward compatible)
- When no roles provided: create User with `role=NULL`, `roles=""`, `needs_onboarding=TRUE`
- Skip `ensure_profile_records()` when no role is set

**New endpoint (`POST /api/auth/onboarding`):**
- Auth: requires valid JWT
- Accepts: `roles: list[str]`, `teacher_type: str | None`
- Validates: at least one role, no admin self-assignment, teacher_type required if teacher
- Actions: set user.role + user.roles, call `ensure_profile_records()`, set teacher_type if applicable, clear `needs_onboarding`
- Audit log: `action="onboarding_complete"`

**User model:**
- New column: `needs_onboarding` (Boolean, default FALSE)
- DB migration in `main.py` startup block
- Included in UserResponse schema and all auth responses (login, register, /me)

**Auth responses:**
- `POST /api/auth/login`, `POST /api/auth/register`, `GET /api/auth/me` all include `needs_onboarding` flag

#### Frontend Changes

**Register.tsx:**
- Remove role checkboxes and teacher type dropdown
- Fields: Full Name, Email, Password, Confirm Password only

**New OnboardingPage.tsx (`/onboarding`):**
- Role selection cards with icons (Parent prominent/first)
- Conditional teacher type sub-selection
- Multi-role checkbox support
- Calls `POST /api/auth/onboarding` on completion
- Redirects to role-specific dashboard
- Matches auth page styling (logo, centered card, theme-aware)

**AuthContext / ProtectedRoute:**
- Check `needs_onboarding` flag from auth response
- Redirect users with `needs_onboarding=true` to `/onboarding`
- Existing users with roles skip onboarding entirely

#### Backward Compatibility
- API still accepts roles at registration (for programmatic/test use)
- Existing users with roles already set have `needs_onboarding=false` (backfill migration)
- Mobile app not affected (registration is web-only per §9.6)

**Sub-tasks:**
- [x] Backend: Make roles optional in registration, add `needs_onboarding` column (#412)
- [x] Backend: `POST /api/auth/onboarding` endpoint with validation and profile creation (#414)
- [x] Frontend: Simplify Register.tsx to 4 fields (#412)
- [x] Frontend: OnboardingPage.tsx with role cards and teacher type selection (#413)
- [x] Frontend: AuthContext/ProtectedRoute onboarding redirect (#413)
- [x] Tests: Onboarding endpoint (happy path, validation, backward compat)

### 6.44 Email Verification (Soft Gate) (Phase 1) - IMPLEMENTED

Verify new users' email addresses after registration using a "soft gate" approach — users can log in without verification but see a persistent dashboard banner reminding them to verify.

**GitHub Issue:** #417

**Flow:**
1. User registers → verification email sent with 24-hour JWT link
2. User can log in immediately (no blocking)
3. Dashboard shows yellow banner: "Please verify your email. [Resend email]"
4. Clicking the email link → `/verify-email?token=...` → email verified
5. Banner disappears after verification

**Backend:**
- **Model:** `email_verified` (Boolean, default `false`) and `email_verified_at` (DateTime, nullable) on User
- **Migration:** `ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN email_verified/email_verified_at` + grandfather existing users as verified
- **Token:** `create_email_verification_token(email)` / `decode_email_verification_token(token)` in `security.py` (24h expiry JWT)
- **Template:** `app/templates/email_verification.html` (ClassBridge branded, matches password_reset pattern)
- **Endpoints:**
  - `POST /api/auth/verify-email` (public) — accepts `{token}`, verifies user email
  - `POST /api/auth/resend-verification` (authenticated, rate-limited 3/min) — resends verification email
- **Registration:** sends verification email after successful signup (best-effort, non-blocking)
- **Auto-verify:** Google OAuth users and invite-accepted users are auto-verified (email already confirmed)
- **Schema:** `email_verified: bool` added to `UserResponse`

**Frontend:**
- **VerifyEmailPage** (`/verify-email?token=...`) — public page, shows success/error/loading states
- **AuthContext:** `email_verified: boolean` on User interface, `resendVerification()` method
- **DashboardLayout:** yellow verification banner with resend button, dismissable per session
- **Routing:** `/verify-email` added as public route in App.tsx

**Sub-tasks:**
- [x] Backend: Add `email_verified`/`email_verified_at` columns + migration + grandfathering (#417)
- [x] Backend: JWT token functions for email verification (#417)
- [x] Backend: `POST /verify-email` and `POST /resend-verification` endpoints (#417)
- [x] Backend: Send verification email on registration, auto-verify Google/invite users (#417)
- [x] Frontend: VerifyEmailPage, AuthContext, DashboardLayout banner, routing (#417)
- [x] Tests: 11 backend tests covering all verification scenarios (#417)

### 6.30 Role-Based Inspirational Messages (Phase 2) - IMPLEMENTED

Replace the static "Welcome back" dashboard greeting with role-specific inspirational messages that rotate on each visit. Messages are maintained in JSON seed files and imported into the database. Admins can manage messages via the admin dashboard.

**Implementation:**
- **Model:** `InspirationMessage` (id, role, text, author, is_active, created_at, updated_at) in `app/models/inspiration_message.py`
- **Seed files:** `data/inspiration/{parent,teacher,student}.json` — 20 messages per role
- **Service:** `app/services/inspiration_service.py` — `seed_messages()` (auto-imports on startup if table empty), `get_random_message(db, role)`
- **API routes:** `app/api/routes/inspiration.py` under `/api/inspiration`
  - `GET /random` — random active message for current user's role (any authenticated user)
  - `GET /messages` — list all messages with role/is_active filters (admin only)
  - `POST /messages` — create new message (admin only)
  - `PATCH /messages/{id}` — update text/author/is_active (admin only)
  - `DELETE /messages/{id}` — delete message (admin only)
  - `POST /seed` — re-import from seed files (admin only, skips if non-empty)
- **Frontend:** `DashboardLayout.tsx` fetches random message on mount, replaces "Welcome back" with italicized quote and author attribution. Falls back to "Welcome back" if no messages.
- **Admin page:** `/admin/inspiration` — full CRUD management with role filter, inline active/inactive toggle, add/edit/delete. Linked from Admin Dashboard.
- **Tests:** 16 tests in `tests/test_inspiration.py` covering random retrieval by role, inactive filtering, admin CRUD, role validation, access control.

**Sub-tasks:**
- [x] Backend: Inspiration model, service, API (#230)
- [x] Data: Seed JSON files per role (#231)
- [x] Frontend: Dashboard greeting integration (#232)
- [x] Backend + Frontend: Admin CRUD + re-import (#233)

## 7. Role-Based Dashboards - IMPLEMENTED

Each user role has a customized dashboard (dispatcher pattern via `Dashboard.tsx`):

| Dashboard | Key Features | Status |
|-----------|--------------|--------|
| **Parent Dashboard** | Left nav (Courses, Study Guides, Messages), calendar-centric main area (Day/3-Day/Week/Month views), child filter tabs with edit child modal, day detail modal (CRUD tasks/assignments), task management with reminders, course color-coding | Implemented (v2 in progress) |
| **Student Dashboard** | Courses, assignments, study tools, Google Classroom sync, file upload | Implemented |
| **Teacher Dashboard** | Courses teaching, manual course creation, multi-Google account management, messages, teacher communications | Implemented (partial) |
| **Admin Dashboard** | Platform stats, user management table (search, filter, pagination), role management, broadcast messaging, individual user messaging | Implemented (messaging planned) |

> **Note:** Phase 4 adds marketplace features (bookings, availability, profiles) to the existing Teacher Dashboard for teachers with `teacher_type=private_tutor`. No separate "Tutor Dashboard" is needed.

### Parent Dashboard Layout (v2) - IN PROGRESS

The Parent Dashboard uses a **three-panel layout**: left navigation, calendar-centric main area, and modal-based management views.

#### Layout Structure
```
[Header (compact padding)                                    ]
[Left Nav        | Child Tabs: Child1 | Child2 | ...         ]
[  Dashboard     | Calendar                                  ]
[  Courses       |   Header: < Today > Title                 ]
[  Study Guides  |   View: Day|3-Day|Week|Month              ]
[  Messages      |   Grid with assignments + tasks           ]
[  + Add Child   |                                           ]
[  + Add Course  |                                           ]
[  + Study Guide |   [+ Create Study Guide] [View Guides]    ]
[  + Add Task    |                                           ]
```

#### 1. Header Row
- Compact padding (reduced from default) to maximize content area

#### 2. Left Navigation
The `DashboardLayout` sidebar includes role-specific navigation items for parents:
- **Home** — Dashboard view (calendar)
- **My Kids** — Per-child view with courses, materials, tasks, teachers
- **Tasks** — Dedicated task management view
- **Messages** — Opens messaging view
- **+ Add Child** — Opens Add Child modal
- **+ Add Course** — Opens Create Course modal
- **+ Create Study Guide** — Opens Study Tools modal
- **+ Add Task** — Opens Add Task modal

> **Note:** Courses was removed from parent nav (#237) since parents access courses through My Kids → child → Courses section.

#### 3. Child Filter Tabs (Toggle Behavior)
- Each child appears as a clickable tab button above the calendar
- **Click** a child tab → filters calendar, courses, and study guides to that child only
- **Click again** (unclick) → deselects child, shows **all children's data combined** plus parent's own tasks
- In "All" mode: calendar merges all children's assignments with child-name labels on each entry
- Single-child families: no tabs shown, child is implicitly selected

#### 4. Edit Child Modal
- Child name in the tab shows an **edit link** (replaces the old "parent/guardian" role label)
- Clicking edit opens a modal with tabs:
  - **Details** — Edit child name, email, grade level, school
  - **Courses** — View/manage assigned courses, assign new courses
  - **Reminders** — Configure reminders for the child (after Task system is built)

#### 5. Calendar Views
- **Month View**: 7-column grid with assignment chips + task dots, click day to open Day Detail Modal
- **Week View**: 7-column layout with stacked assignment/task cards
- **3-Day View**: 3-column layout identical to Week but showing only 3 days
- **Day View**: Single-column list of all assignments + tasks for one day

#### 6. Day Detail Modal
Clicking a **date** on the calendar opens a modal showing all items for that day:
- Lists all assignments and tasks for the selected date
- Each item shows: title, type (assignment/task), course (if applicable), time, status
- **Add Task** button to create a new task for that date
- **Edit/Delete** actions on each item (CRUD)
- For assignments: "Create Study Guide" action
- Scoped to selected child or all children based on filter state

#### 7. Tasks with Reminders
- **Add Task** button in left nav and in Day Detail Modal
- Task modal fields: title, description, due date, reminder date+time (time optional), priority, linked child (optional)
- Tasks appear on calendar alongside assignments (visually distinct)
- Clicking a task on the calendar opens it for editing
- Reminders trigger in-app notifications

#### 8. Courses View (Left Nav → `/courses`)
Dedicated page for course management (accessible to all roles):
- **List all courses** — parent-created + child-enrolled courses (parent view); all visible courses (student/teacher view)
- **Click course card** → navigates to Course Detail Page (`/courses/:id`) for full content management
- **Create new course** — name, subject, description (all roles)
- **Assign to children** — parent only, supports assigning one course to multiple children
- **Course Detail Page** — edit course, CRUD content, upload documents, generate study materials (see §6.4.2)
- Course cards show: name, subject, teacher name, Google badge

#### 9. Study Guides View (Left Nav → `/study-guides`)
Dedicated page for study guide management:
- **List all guides** — parent's own + children's guides
- **Create study guide** — opens Study Tools modal (text or file upload)
- **Assign to course** — CourseAssignSelect dropdown on each guide
- **CRUD operations** — view, edit metadata, delete
- Filter by: type (guide/quiz/flashcards), course, child

#### Calendar Components (Reusable)
Located in `frontend/src/components/calendar/`:
- `useCalendarNav` — Hook for date navigation, view mode, range computation
- `CalendarView` — Orchestrator component (header + active grid + popover)
- `CalendarHeader` — Nav buttons, title, view toggle
- `CalendarMonthGrid` / `CalendarDayCell` — Month view grid
- `CalendarWeekGrid` — Week/3-day column layout
- `CalendarDayGrid` — Single-day list view
- `CalendarEntry` — Assignment/task rendered as chip (month) or card (week/day); tasks are draggable for rescheduling
- `CalendarEntryPopover` — Assignment/task detail popover
- `DayDetailModal` — Full CRUD modal for a specific date (new)

#### Drag-and-Drop Task Rescheduling
- Tasks can be dragged to a different day in month view (chips) or week/3-day view (cards)
- Uses native HTML5 Drag and Drop API (no external library)
- Drop targets (day cells, week columns) highlight with blue dashed outline during drag
- Optimistic UI: task moves immediately on drop, reverts if API update fails
- Only tasks are draggable — classroom assignments remain fixed
- Drag data carries task ID and `itemType: 'task'` for validation

#### Key Design Details
- **Course Color-Coding**: 10-color palette assigned by course index, consistent everywhere
- **Task vs Assignment**: Assignments have course color border; tasks have a distinct style (e.g., dashed border or priority-based color)
- **Responsive**: At < 1024px, left nav collapses to icons; calendar takes full width
- **Right sidebar removed**: Courses and Study Guides promoted to dedicated pages via left nav

### Parent-Student Relationship
Parents and students have a **many-to-many** relationship via the `parent_students` join table. A student can have multiple parents (mother, father, guardian), and parent linking is optional.

**Registration & Linking Methods:**
- **Parent Registers Child**: Create a student account from the Parent Dashboard; child receives an invite email to set their password
- **Link by Email**: Enter an existing student's registered email address
- **Via Google Classroom**: Connect Google account, auto-discover children enrolled in Google Classroom courses, select and bulk-link
- **Self-Registered Student**: Students can register independently and use the platform without any parent

### Role-Based Access Control
- Backend: `require_role()` dependency factory for endpoint-level role checking
- Frontend: `ProtectedRoute` component with optional `allowedRoles` prop
- Shared `DashboardLayout` component for common header/nav across all dashboards

- [ ] **Frontend DDD modules** — Reorganize into domain directories (#133)
- [ ] **Domain events** — Add event system for cross-context communication (#134)

#### Security & Hardening (Tier 0)
- [ ] **Authorization gaps** — `list_students()` returns ALL students to any auth user; `get_user()` has no permission check; `list_assignments()` not filtered by course access (#139)
- [ ] **Rate limiting** — No rate limiting on AI generation, auth, or file upload endpoints; risk of brute force and API quota abuse (#140)
- [x] **CORS hardening** — ~~Currently allows `*` origins; tighten to known frontend domains (#64)~~ ✅ Fixed in #177
- [ ] **Security headers** — Add X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, Strict-Transport-Security, CSP (#141)
- [ ] **Input validation** — Missing field length limits, URL validation, and sanitization on multiple endpoints (#142)

- [x] **N+1 query patterns** — ~~`_task_to_response()` does 3-4 extra queries per task; `list_children()` iterates students; assignment reminder job loads all users individually (#144)~~ ✅ Fixed with selectinload/batch-fetch in tasks.py, messages.py, parent.py (#241)
- [x] **CASCADE delete rules** — ~~Task, StudyGuide, Assignment FKs lack ON DELETE CASCADE/SET NULL; orphaned records possible (#145)~~ ✅ Fixed in #187
- [x] **Unique constraint on parent_students** — ~~No unique constraint on (parent_id, student_id); duplicate links possible (#146)~~ ✅ Fixed in #187

#### Frontend UX Gaps (Tier 1)
- [x] **Global error boundary** — React ErrorBoundary wraps all routes; catches render errors with Try Again / Reload Page (#147) ✅
- [x] **Toast notification system** — Global ToastProvider with success/error/info types, auto-dismiss, click-to-dismiss (#148) ✅
- [ ] **Token refresh** — JWT tokens expire without refresh mechanism; users lose work and get silently redirected to login (#149)
- [x] **Loading skeletons** — Reusable Skeleton components (Page, Card, List, Detail) replace Loading... text across 12 pages (#150) ✅
- [x] **Accessibility (A11Y)** — ARIA labels on icon buttons, keyboard navigation for interactive elements, skip-to-content link, focus indicators (#151, #247) ✅ (IMPLEMENTED - Feb 2026, commit 120e065)
- [ ] **Mobile responsiveness** — Calendar not optimized for mobile; tables don't scroll; modals overflow on small screens; no touch drag-drop (#152)
- [x] **FlashcardsPage stale closure bug** — Fixed with useRef-based stable keyboard event handler (#153) ✅

#### Testing Gaps (Tier 1)
- [x] **Frontend unit tests** — 258 tests across 18 files (vitest) (#154) ✅
- [ ] **Missing route tests** — No tests for: google_classroom, study, messages, notifications, teacher_communications, admin, invites, course_contents routes (#155)
- [ ] **PostgreSQL test coverage** — Tests run on SQLite only; misses NOT NULL, Enum, and type divergences (e.g., users.email bug) (#156)

### Phase 1.5 (Calendar Extension, Content, Mobile & School Integration)
- [ ] Mobile-responsive web application (fix CSS gaps, breakpoints, touch support)
- [ ] Student email identity merging (personal + school email on same account)
- [ ] School board email integration (when DTAP approved)

### Phase 2 (Mobile App — March 6 Pilot MVP) - IN PROGRESS

See §9 Mobile App Development for detailed specification.

**Status:** Parent-only MVP complete (8 screens built). Device testing and pilot launch pending.

**Approach:** Lightweight parent-only mobile app for March 6, 2026 pilot. No backend API changes needed — mobile calls the same `/api/*` endpoints as the web frontend. Distributed via Expo Go (no App Store/Play Store submission for pilot).

**Timeline:** 2 weeks (Feb 15 - Mar 5, 2026)
- Week 1 (Feb 15-21): Foundation + all 8 screens ✅
- Week 2 (Feb 22-28): Polish + device testing
- Mar 1-5: Final testing + pilot prep

**Deliverables:**

## 9. Mobile App Development

> **Status:** Parent-only MVP complete (8 screens). Device testing pending for March 6 pilot.

---

### 9.1 Overview

**Technology Stack:** React Native + TypeScript with Expo (managed workflow)

**Platforms:** iOS 13+ and Android 8.0+

**Approach:** Parent-only "monitor & communicate" mobile app for the March 6, 2026 pilot. All complex workflows (registration, course management, study material generation, teacher linking) remain web-only. Mobile is read-heavy with limited write actions (reply to messages, mark tasks complete, mark notifications read).

**Key Design Decision:** No backend API changes needed for the mobile MVP. The existing `/api/*` endpoints return all data the mobile app needs. The mobile API client calls the same endpoints as the web frontend.

**GitHub Issues:** #364-#380 (pilot MVP + post-pilot enhancements)

### 9.2 Strategic Decision: React Native with Expo

**Selected Approach:** React Native with Expo SDK 54 (managed workflow)

**Rationale:**
1. **Maximum Code Reuse**: Web app already uses React — shared API types, business logic, patterns
2. **Single Team**: Same tooling (npm, TypeScript, VSCode), hot reload like web
3. **Fast Development**: 8 screens built in under a week using web API types as reference
4. **Expo Go Distribution**: No App Store submission needed for pilot — parents install Expo Go and scan QR code
5. **Native Performance**: Sufficient for educational platform (not gaming/AR)

### 9.3 Mobile Stack (Actual)

**Core:**
- React Native 0.81.5
- TypeScript 5.x
- Expo SDK 54

**Navigation:**
- React Navigation 7 (native stack + bottom tabs)

**State & Data Management (shared patterns with web):**
- TanStack React Query 5.x (same query keys and patterns as web)
- Axios (same interceptor pattern as web)
- AsyncStorage (localStorage equivalent for token storage)

**UI:**
- @expo/vector-icons (MaterialIcons)
- react-native-safe-area-context
- Custom theme system matching ClassBridge brand colors

**Deferred (Phase 3+):**
- React Native Firebase (push notifications)
- Expo Image Picker / Document Picker (file uploads)
- React Native MMKV (offline cache persistence)

### 9.4 Backend API Changes

**Key Decision: No backend changes needed for the March 6 pilot.** The existing `/api/*` endpoints return all data the mobile app needs. CORS is not a factor for React Native (native HTTP clients bypass browser CORS restrictions). The mobile API client calls the exact same endpoints as the web frontend.

**Deferred backend API work** (to be implemented post-pilot as needed):
- Issue #311: API Versioning (`/api/v1`) — Not needed when you control both clients
- Issue #312: Pagination on all list endpoints — Not needed for pilot scale
- Issue #313: Structured error responses — Nice-to-have for Phase 3
- Issues #314-#318: Firebase push notifications — Deferred to Phase 3 (late March)
- Issues #319-#320: File upload endpoints — Not needed for read-only parent mobile
- Issue #321: Health endpoint with version info — Deferred
- Issue #322: Integration tests for v1 API — Deferred (no v1 API yet)

### 9.5 Mobile App — What Was Built (Pilot MVP)

**Project:** `ClassBridgeMobile/` — Expo SDK 54 managed workflow

#### 9.5.1 Foundation (Issues #364-#366) ✅ COMPLETE

**API Client (#364)** — Ported from `frontend/src/api/client.ts`
- `src/api/client.ts` — Axios instance with AsyncStorage token management
- Token refresh interceptor (same logic as web, using AsyncStorage instead of localStorage)
- Form-urlencoded login (backend uses `OAuth2PasswordRequestForm`)
- `src/api/parent.ts` — ParentDashboardData, ChildHighlight, ChildOverview types
- `src/api/messages.ts` — ConversationSummary, ConversationDetail, MessageResponse types
- `src/api/notifications.ts` — NotificationResponse type + list/read/count functions
- `src/api/tasks.ts` — TaskItem type + list/toggleComplete functions

**Auth & Login (#365)**
- `src/context/AuthContext.tsx` — Token in AsyncStorage, auto-load user on app start, login/logout
- `src/screens/auth/LoginScreen.tsx` — Email/password form, validation, error display

**Navigation (#366)**
- `src/navigation/AppNavigator.tsx` — Auth-gated navigation:
  - Not authenticated → LoginScreen
  - Authenticated → Bottom tab navigator (Home, Calendar, Messages, Notifications, Profile)
  - HomeStack: Dashboard → ChildOverview (nested stack)
  - MsgStack: ConversationsList → Chat (nested stack)

#### 9.5.2 Core Screens (Issues #367-#373) ✅ COMPLETE

| Screen | Issue | API Endpoint | Key Features |
|--------|-------|-------------|--------------|
| ParentDashboardScreen | #367 | `GET /api/parent/dashboard` | Greeting, 3 status cards (overdue/due today/messages), child cards with avatars and status badges |
| ChildOverviewScreen | #368 | `GET /api/parent/children/{id}/overview` + `GET /api/tasks/` | Courses list, assignments sorted by due date, tasks with complete toggle |
| CalendarScreen | #369 | Dashboard `all_assignments` + tasks API | Custom month grid, color-coded date dots, tap date → day items list |
| MessagesListScreen | #370 | `GET /api/messages/conversations` | Conversation cards, unread badges, time formatting, tap → Chat |
| ChatScreen | #371 | `GET /api/messages/conversations/{id}` + `POST .../messages` | Chat bubbles (sent/received), date separators, send message, auto-mark-read |
| NotificationsScreen | #372 | `GET /api/notifications/` | Type-specific icons, mark as read, mark all read, relative timestamps |
| ProfileScreen | #373 | `GET /api/auth/me` | User info, unread counts, Google status, logout, web app reminder |

#### 9.5.3 UI Polish (#374) ✅ COMPLETE

- SafeArea handling via `useSafeAreaInsets` on headerless screens
- Native headers on Calendar, Notifications, Profile tabs
- Tab bar badges with 30-second polling (Messages: unread count, Notifications: unread count)
- Pull-to-refresh (`RefreshControl`) on all list/scroll screens
- Empty states with icons and messages
- Loading spinners with messages

#### 9.5.4 Remaining Pilot Work

- [x] **Device testing prep (#375):** ESLint 9 flat config migration, unused import cleanup, dependency compatibility fix (`react-native-screens`), `useMemo` dependency fix in ChatScreen — TypeScript and ESLint pass clean, Metro Bundler starts successfully
- [ ] **Device testing (#375):** Test on physical iOS device via Expo Go, test on physical Android device
- [x] **Pilot onboarding docs (#362):** Welcome email template (`docs/pilot/welcome-email.md`), quick-start guide with Expo Go instructions, known limitations, and feedback mechanism (`docs/pilot/quick-start-guide.md`)
- [ ] **Pilot launch checklist (#376):** Verify mobile connects to production API, prepare Expo Go instructions

### 9.6 Mobile Boundary (What's Mobile vs Web-Only)

**MOBILE (parent read/reply only):**
- View dashboard: children status cards (overdue, due today, courses)
- View child detail: courses, assignments, upcoming deadlines
- View calendar: assignments & tasks by date (read-only)
- View/reply messages: parent-teacher conversations
- View notifications: mark as read
- Mark tasks complete: single tap toggle
- View profile & logout

**WEB ONLY (complex workflows):**
- Registration & account setup
- Create/link/edit children (invites, Google discovery)
- Create courses, assign to children, Google sync
- Link teachers (invite flow, email notifications)
- Generate study materials (AI, file upload)
- Create tasks with full detail & resource linking
- Teacher email monitoring (Gmail OAuth)
- All admin functions
- All student & teacher functions

## 10. Technical Architecture

### Stack
- **Frontend:** React + TypeScript + Vite
- **Backend:** Python (FastAPI)
- **AI Services:** OpenAI GPT-4o-mini / Vertex AI
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (production), SQLite (development)
- **Object Storage:** Google Cloud Storage
- **Authentication:** OAuth2 + RBAC

### Architecture Direction: Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

ClassBridge is migrating from a transaction-script pattern to a modular Domain-Driven Design (DDD) architecture. Current maturity grade: **C-**. This migration is tracked across issues #127–#134 and will be implemented incrementally alongside feature work.

#### Current Architecture Issues
- **Backend**: Business logic lives in route handlers, no repository layer, cross-domain coupling (tasks imports 3+ domain models), anemic models, no domain events
- **Frontend**: `ParentDashboard.tsx` is 1222 LOC with 33+ useState hooks, `api/client.ts` is 794 LOC monolith, TanStack Query installed but unused, no custom hooks

#### Bounded Contexts

| Context | Backend Domain | Frontend Module | Models |
|---------|---------------|-----------------|--------|
| **Auth & Identity** | `app/domains/auth/` | `src/domains/auth/` | User, Student, Teacher, Invite |
| **Education** | `app/domains/education/` | `src/domains/education/` | Course, Assignment, CourseContent, Enrollment |
| **Study Tools** | `app/domains/study/` | `src/domains/study/` | StudyGuide (guide, quiz, flashcards) |
| **Tasks & Planning** | `app/domains/tasks/` | `src/domains/tasks/` | Task, RecurringTaskTemplate (future) |
| **Communication** | `app/domains/communication/` | `src/domains/communication/` | Conversation, Message, TeacherCommunication |
| **Notifications** | `app/domains/notifications/` | `src/domains/notifications/` | Notification, NotificationPreference |

#### Target Backend Structure (per domain)
```
app/domains/{context}/
  models.py        # SQLAlchemy models (aggregate roots)
  schemas.py       # Pydantic request/response models
  repository.py    # Data access layer (abstracts DB queries)
  service.py       # Business logic (orchestrates repos + rules)
  routes.py        # FastAPI router (thin, delegates to service)
  events.py        # Domain events (future, #134)
```

#### Target Frontend Structure (per domain)
```
src/domains/{context}/
  api.ts           # Axios calls for this domain only
  hooks.ts         # TanStack Query hooks (useQuery, useMutation)
  types.ts         # TypeScript interfaces
  components/      # Domain-specific UI components
  pages/           # Route-level pages
```

#### Migration Phases
1. **Phase A (Foundation)**: Split `api/client.ts` (#127), extract backend services (#128), introduce repository pattern (#129)
2. **Phase B (Frontend)**: Split `ParentDashboard` (#130), activate TanStack Query (#131)
3. **Phase C (Full DDD)**: Reorganize backend into domain modules (#132), reorganize frontend into domain modules (#133)
4. **Phase D (Events)**: Add domain events for cross-context communication (#134)

### Google OAuth Scopes
| Scope | Purpose | Used By |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `classroom.courses.readonly` | Read Google Classroom courses | All roles (sync) |
| `classroom.coursework.students.readonly` | Read assignments | Student, Parent |
| `classroom.rosters.readonly` | Read course rosters (teacher info) | Parent (discover children) |
| `gmail.readonly` | Read teacher emails for monitoring | Teacher |
| `calendar.events` | Push tasks/reminders to Google Calendar | All roles (Phase 1.5) |
| `userinfo.email`, `userinfo.profile` | Basic identity for OAuth | All roles |

**Notes:**
- Scopes are requested incrementally — only `userinfo` + `classroom` scopes at initial connect; `calendar.events` requested when user enables Google Calendar sync
- Teachers with multi-Google accounts: each `teacher_google_accounts` entry stores its own tokens with the scopes relevant to that account
- Scope expansion requires Google OAuth verification (Issue #14)

## 10. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Availability:** 99.9% uptime
- **Performance:** <2s response time
- **Scalability:** 100k+ users
- **Security:** Encryption in transit and at rest
- **Compliance:** FERPA, MFIPPA, PIPEDA, GDPR (if applicable)

### 10.1 Data Privacy & User Rights

ClassBridge handles student data subject to FERPA, PIPEDA, and MFIPPA. The following capabilities are required (implementation deferred to Phase 2+):

- **Account Deletion**: Users can request full account deletion. System must cascade-delete or anonymize all related records (tasks, messages, parent-student links, study materials, Google tokens).
- **Data Export**: Users can request a machine-readable export (JSON/CSV) of all personal data (GDPR Article 20, PIPEDA right of access).
- **Consent Management**: Track and store user consent for data collection, Google OAuth scopes, and email communications. Allow users to withdraw consent.
- **Data Retention**: Define retention periods for inactive accounts, expired invites, and completed tasks. Auto-purge after defined periods.
- **Minor Data Protection**: Student accounts (especially those created by parents) require additional protections — no marketing emails, limited data sharing, parental consent for under-13 users.
- **Audit Logging**: Log access to sensitive data (parent viewing child data, admin viewing user list) for compliance auditing. **Phase 1 implementation complete** — see §6.14. Future: log export, alerting, archival to external storage.
