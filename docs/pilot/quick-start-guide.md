## Step 3: Explore Your Dashboard

Your dashboard shows everything at a glance:

| Section | What It Shows |
|---------|---------------|
| **Overdue** | Assignments past their due date |
| **Due Today** | What's due today across all children |
| **Messages** | Unread messages from teachers |
| **Your Children** | Tap a child's name to see their courses, assignments, and tasks |

---

## Step 4: Check Assignments and Tasks

1. From the Dashboard, tap your **child's name**
2. You'll see their:
   - **Courses** (synced from Google Classroom)
   - **Assignments** sorted by due date (overdue items appear first)
   - **Tasks** with checkboxes you can toggle

---

## Step 5: Use the Calendar

Tap the **Calendar** tab (bottom bar) to see all assignments and tasks in a monthly view.

- **Blue dot** = items on that day
- **Red dot** = overdue items
- **Yellow dot** = busy day (3+ items)
- Tap any day to see the full list

---

## Step 6: Message a Teacher

1. Tap the **Messages** tab (bottom bar)
2. You'll see your conversations with teachers
3. Tap a conversation to read and reply
4. Unread messages show a **red badge** on the Messages tab

## Step 7: Check Notifications

Tap the **Notifications** tab to see alerts about:
- New assignments posted
- Assignment due date reminders
- Messages from teachers

You can mark individual notifications as read, or tap **"Mark all read"** at the top.
