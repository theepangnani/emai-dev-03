## 1. Why this plan exists

Mentor review of CB-CMCP-001 PRD v1.0 surfaced four authenticity gaps (now A1–A4 binding amendments in PRD v1.1) and eleven strategic-decision items. The user asked for *"a detailed batch implementation plan"* using design-thinking principles, with explicit emphasis on **reusability, extensibility, scalability, simplicity**, and **domain-driven design**.

This plan is a single source of truth for *how* CB-CMCP-001 ships — the bounded contexts, the batches, the integration sequence, and the gates between milestones. It does **not** override the open decisions: it codifies the **default working assumptions** (mentor recommendations from D1–D11) so engineering can proceed without re-litigating each batch, and explicitly calls out the boundary edits required if any decision lands differently.

This document does **not** start development — it is a planning artifact, reviewable as a PR before any code stripe is opened.

---

## 2. Working assumptions (mentor-recommendation defaults)

All eleven decisions remain user-owned. For planning purposes the recommendations from D1–D11 are taken as defaults. Each is annotated with its **boundary-edit cost** if reversed.

| # | Decision | Default | If reversed |
|---|---|---|---|
| D1 | One MCP vs two | **C — defer board MCP** | Cheap. M2 batch 2a still ports the scaffold; the board-side `BOARD_ADMIN` tool surface is just deferred. Reversing later = open a new MCP deployment. |
| D2 | `study_guides` vs new `content_artifacts` | **B — extend `study_guides`** | Medium. Schema choice cascades. If reversed mid-flight, new code dual-writes during a migration window. Decide before M0 batch 0a. |
| D3 | Self-study path | **C — hybrid (self-study + class-distribute)** | Cheap. State-machine just gains/loses a `SELF_STUDY` state. UI swaps badges. |
| D4 | Validator second-pass | **C in M1, B in M3** | Cheap. Validator is a pluggable post-step. Adding embedding similarity is additive. |
| D5 | CEG extraction quality | **B — two-pass + paid OCT reviewer** | Cheap engineering, expensive headcount. If reversed (single-pass + admin), accuracy SLA drops; CEG release criteria loosen. |
| D6 | Latency NFRs + streaming | **B — per-type SLA + streaming** | Medium. Streaming UX touches ~5 frontend components. Reversing to sync-only forces shorter-form artifacts only. |
| D7 | Board surface | **B — REST/LTI primary, MCP secondary** | Cheap. Board REST endpoints are an additive layer on top of the same data model. |
| D8 | Cost model | **B — estimate now** | Cheap. ~1 day of analysis. Saves a budget surprise mid-M1. |
| D9 | CEG version cascade | **B — severity classifier** | Cheap. One column on `ceg_versions` + one job. |
| D10 | IEP scope | **B — defer to Phase 2** | Cheap. 3 difficulty tiers ship; IEP customization is teacher-edit-time. |
| D11 | Board interviews | **B — interviews in parallel with M0** | Strategic, not engineering. CEG (M0) has B2C value regardless. |

**The plan below assumes all eleven defaults.** Each batch flags decision dependencies in its preconditions. Decisions D1, D2, D3, D5, D7, D11 are the **M0 hard gates** — must be confirmed before M0 batch 0a opens.

## 3. Domain-driven design model

### 3.1 Bounded contexts

CB-CMCP-001 spans six bounded contexts. Each owns its data, its language, and its integration contracts. Cross-context communication is by **domain events** (not direct DB joins).

### 3.2 Aggregates per context

Each aggregate has a **root entity** (transactional consistency boundary) and **value objects**.

| Context | Aggregate root | Value objects | Key invariants |
|---|---|---|---|
| Curriculum | `Expectation` (one OE or SE) | `MinistryCode`, `Strand`, `CurriculumVersion`, `Embedding` | An SE always has a `parent_oe_id`. Active SEs are always within the latest `CurriculumVersion` per subject/grade. |
| Generation | `GenerationRun` (one CGP request) | `GuardrailEnvelope` (CEG SE list + class-context), `VoiceModuleHash`, `AlignmentScore`, `EngineRoute` | Every run has a guardrail envelope. Voice module hash is recorded at generation time. Alignment score ∈ [0,1]. |
| Authoring | `ContentArtifact` (extends `study_guides` per D2) | `ArtifactState`, `EditDelta`, `ApprovalDecision`, `ReviewerId` | State machine is acyclic except DRAFT↔PENDING_REVIEW. Approved artifacts are immutable; new approval = new version row. |
| Surface | `SurfaceDispatch` (one fan-out event) | `DCICoachCard`, `DigestBlock`, `BridgeCard`, `DispatchOutcome` | All three derivative payloads are emitted best-effort; failure of one does NOT block others or the artifact's APPROVED state. |
| Authorization | `RolePolicy` (existing dev-03; extended) | `BoardScope`, `CurriculumAdminScope` | New roles added: `BOARD_ADMIN`, `CURRICULUM_ADMIN`. Existing PARENT/STUDENT/TEACHER/ADMIN unchanged. |
| Distribution | `BoardCatalog` (one board's view) | `CatalogQuery`, `CoverageMap`, `ExportFormat` | Board sees only `state=APPROVED` + `board_id` matches. Cross-board content visibility is OFF by default. |

### 3.3 Domain events

Cross-context communication is via these events. Each is a published record with `event_id`, `occurred_at`, `payload`. We do **not** introduce a message broker; events are emitted in-process as DB-backed work items, polled by a background worker (matches existing dev-03 task-sync pattern).

| Event | Producer context | Consumer contexts | Trigger |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ExpectationVersioned` | Curriculum | Generation, Authoring | New `CurriculumVersion` row + diff against prior version |
| `ClassContextAvailable` | (External: ASGF + course_contents) | Generation | Teacher uploads new course material; new course content tagged to a class |
| `ArtifactGenerated` | Generation | Authoring | CGP run completes (DRAFT or PENDING_REVIEW state) |
| `AlignmentScored` | Generation | Authoring (validator dashboard) | Post-gen validator finishes |
| `ArtifactApproved` | Authoring | Surface, Distribution | Teacher approves → state APPROVED |
| `ArtifactReClassified` | Curriculum | Authoring | CEG version cascade: a tagged SE changed; flag affected artifacts (only `change_severity = scope_substantive`) |
| `BoardCatalogQueried` | Distribution | (telemetry) | Audit + rate-limit signal |

### 3.4 Anti-corruption layers

External systems are bounded behind ACLs to preserve our domain language:

- **Claude / OpenAI** → `AIEngineRouter` (existing in `app/services/ai_service.py`). Translates `GenerationRequest` → provider-specific API; never leaks provider model strings into domain code.
- **Google Classroom** → existing `app/services/google_classroom_*.py`. ACL already in place.
- **Ontario Ministry PDFs** → `CEGExtractor` (M0 batch 0b). Strictly inbound. Never used at runtime — only during periodic CEG rebuild jobs.

## 4. Architecture overview

### 4.1 Layered architecture (per context)

Every context follows the same internal layering — keeps the codebase predictable and reusable patterns transferable across contexts.

### 4.2 Generation pipeline data flow (the critical path)

```
1. User request                   2. Class context envelope     3. CEG retrieval
   • User identity + role            • Pull from:                  • Structured: by grade/subject/strand
   • Grade / subject / strand        ▸ course_contents             • Semantic: embedding match (pgvector)
   • Content type + difficulty       ▸ GC announcements (14d)      → list of OE + SE expectations
   • Optional: target SE codes       ▸ teacher email digest (30d)
                                     ▸ teacher artifact library
                                     → cited sources

4. Prompt construction            5. AI engine routing          6. Generation
   • Curriculum guardrail layer      • Claude Sonnet for          • Streaming SSE for long-form
   • Class-context layer (A1)          long-form (study guide,    • Sync for short artifacts
   • Voice overlay (A3)                sample test, assignment)   • Token usage logged
   • Persona overlay (A2)            • GPT-4o-mini for high-      • Voice module hash stamped
                                       volume (quiz, worksheet)

7. Post-gen validation            8. Persist                    9. Surface integration (A4)
   • Self-report check               • content_artifacts row     • If state = APPROVED:
   • Second-pass validator           • content_json + alignment    ▸ DCICoachCard emit
     (port phase-2                     metadata                     ▸ DigestBlock emit
      CurriculumMappingService)       • PDF render (deferred to     ▸ BridgeEntry emit
   • If alignment ≥ threshold:         on-demand)                   (best-effort; failure ≠ block)
     → state DRAFT                     • Domain event:
   • Else:                             ArtifactGenerated
     → state DRAFT + flagged
```

### 4.3 Integration with existing dev-03 systems

| Existing system | Role in CB-CMCP-001 | Touch point |
|---|---|---|
| `app/services/ai_service.py` | Reused as engine router; gain `class_context_envelope` + `voice_module_id` parameters | Extend, don't replace |
| `app/models/study_guide.py` | Becomes the `ContentArtifact` table (extended per D2) | Add columns: `se_codes` JSONB, `alignment_score`, `ceg_version`, `state`, `board_id`, `voice_module_hash`, `class_context_envelope_summary` |
| CB-ASGF-001 ingestion | Source for class-context envelope (A1) | Reuse pipeline; new `ClassContextResolver` calls into it |
| CB-PEDI-002 digest | Surface for Email Digest summary block (A4) | Add new block-renderer for `cb_cmcp_artifact_summary` |
| CB-DCI-001 | Surface for Daily Check-In coach card (A4) | Extend DCI ingest contract to accept artifact-derived cards |
| CB-BRIDGE-001 | Surface for "What child is learning" Bridge card (A4) | New card type + API + frontend component |
| CB-TASKSYNC-001 | Class assignments emit Tasks | When approved artifact assigned to class roster, emit `TaskCreated` |
| CB-TUTOR-001/002 Arc | Voice reference for A3 | Inherit voice rules; share `arc_voice_v*.txt` registry |
| Existing JWT + OAuth2 | Auth for MCP (port from phase-2) | Add `BOARD_ADMIN` / `CURRICULUM_ADMIN` roles |
| Existing SSE pattern (`/tutor`, `/asgf`) | Streaming UX for long-form generation | Reuse SSE plumbing |

---

## 5. Reuse inventory (port from phase-2 + extend in dev-03)

This is the load-bearing claim that lets CB-CMCP-001 ship in 9 months instead of 18. Each row is concrete code that exists today.

### 5.1 Port from `class-bridge-phase-2` `feature/phase-2`

| Asset | LOC | Maps to | Port batch |
|---|---|---|---|
| `app/models/curriculum.py` (`CurriculumExpectation`) | 28 | CEG aggregate root (extend) | M0 batch 0a |
| `app/data/curriculum_seed.py` | 334 | Seeding pattern (replace data with Gr 1–8) | M0 batch 0b |
| `app/api/routes/curriculum.py` | 218 | Curriculum read REST API | M0 batch 0a |
| `app/services/curriculum_mapping.py` (`CurriculumMappingService.annotate()`) | 141 | M1 second-pass alignment validator (D4) | M1 batch 1d |
| `app/services/parent_summary.py` (`ParentSummaryService.generate()`) | 116 | A2 Parent Companion ~70% (extend) | M1 batch 1f |
| `app/mcp/__init__.py` | 125 | MCP server scaffold | M2 batch 2a |
| `app/mcp/auth.py` | 155 | MCP JWT + RBAC | M2 batch 2a (extend with BOARD_ADMIN/CURRICULUM_ADMIN) |
| `app/mcp/resources/student.py` | 779 | A1 student-context envelope | M1 batch 1b |
| `app/mcp/tools/study.py` | 459 | Dedup + rate-limit pattern; replace endpoints with curriculum-guardrailed | M2 batch 2c |
| `app/mcp/tools/tutor.py` | 611 | Defer (relevant to end-user MCP, not board) | Out of M0–M4 scope |
| `app/mcp/tools/import_tools.py` | 403 | Out of CB-CMCP-001 scope | (covered by #2196) |

### 5.2 Already in dev-03 (extend, don't duplicate)

| Asset | Role |
|---|---|
| `app/services/ai_service.py` | Engine router; extend with envelope + voice |
| `app/models/study_guide.py` | Becomes `ContentArtifact` per D2 |
| `app/models/course_content.py` | Class-context source (A1) |
| `app/services/asgf_*` services | Class-context ingestion source (A1) |
| `app/services/pedi_*` services | Email Digest summary block target (A4) |
| `app/services/dci_*` services | Daily Check-In coach card target (A4) |
| Bridge components (`frontend/src/components/bridge/*`) | Bridge entry render target (A4) |
| Tutor's `arc_voice_*` patterns (CB-TUTOR-001/002) | A3 voice reference |
| `app/services/tasks/task_sync_*` (CB-TASKSYNC-001) | Class assignment task emission |
| `app/db/database.py` + advisory-lock migration pattern | M0 schema migrations |
| Existing SSE patterns in `tutor.py` / `asgf` | Streaming UX (D6) |

---

## 6. UI/UX strategy

### 6.1 Inherit, don't invent

CB-CMCP-001 has **five new user-facing surfaces**. None gets a new design system — all inherit the existing Bridge / Fraunces serif heading / rust-accent / dark-pill primary CTA / warm-ivory-surface tokens from CB-THEME-001 + CB-BRIDGE-001 + CB-TUTOR-001. Reuse, not reinvent. The only new visual primitive is a **curriculum-code chip** (see §6.4).

### 6.2 The five surfaces

| Surface | Role | Inherits | Owner persona |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Generation request flow** | User picks grade/subject/strand → requests artifact (or accepts class-context-detected suggestion) | CB-ASGF-001 entry-point shape; Bridge tokens | Student / Parent / Teacher |
| **Teacher Review Queue** | Queue of `state=PENDING_REVIEW` artifacts; approve / edit / regenerate | Existing teacher portal layout; Bridge tokens; tutor inline-edit pattern | Teacher |
| **Parent Companion view** | Render the 5-section Parent Companion artifact; deep-link into Bridge | Bridge `/my-hub` card style; warm coaching tone (NOT Arc-led) | Parent |
| **Curriculum / SE picker** | Browse Ontario expectations by grade/subject/strand; pick SEs to anchor a request | New (table + tree) — uses Bridge spacing/typography | Teacher / Curriculum Admin |
| **Board Admin Dashboard** | Coverage map (strand × content-count heatmap); catalog browse; export | New (dashboard) — uses Bridge tokens + recharts (per CB-PEDI-002 pattern) | Board Admin |

### 6.3 User journey examples (Double Diamond informed)

**Maya (Grade 8 student, YRDSB) — "I want a quiz on linear equations":**

```
DISCOVER:  "I have a math test Thursday on linear equations"
DEFINE:    Request → grade/subject/strand prefilled from her enrolled course
DEVELOP:   System generates with class-context envelope (Mr. Chen's recent slides
           + GC announcement) → Arc-voiced quiz with worked examples
DELIVER:   Artifact appears in /tutor; auto-emits coach card to her parent's DCI
           tomorrow morning
```

**Priya (Grade 5 parent, YRDSB) — "How do I help with biodiversity?":**

```
DISCOVER:  Bridge "What Aarav is learning" card surfaces curriculum SEs A1.2-A1.3
DEFINE:    Tap → "Get a Parent Companion" CTA
DEVELOP:   Self-service generation, no teacher review (D3=C, self-study path)
           → 5-section Parent Companion (NOT a worksheet)
DELIVER:   Lands in next morning's Email Digest + persists in her Bridge view.
           Three coaching prompts she can use over dinner.
```

**Mr. Chen (Grade 7 teacher) — "I need a homework assignment":**

```
DISCOVER:  Class-context envelope auto-built from his uploads + GC announcements
DEFINE:    Curriculum picker shows SEs covered in last 14 days
DEVELOP:   Generate → review queue → he edits 2 lines → approve
DELIVER:   Auto-shared with class roster (CB-TASKSYNC-001 emits Tasks);
           coach card to each enrolled student's parent's DCI
```

**TDSB Curriculum Coordinator — "Show me Grade 9 Math coverage":**

```
DISCOVER:  REST: GET /api/board/{board_id}/coverage?grade=9&subject=MATH
DEFINE:    Coverage map: strand × approved-artifact-count heatmap
DEVELOP:   Click a strand → list of approved artifacts in that strand
DELIVER:   Signed CSV export (D7=B) for LMS import; LTI link-out stub for
           direct integration testing
```

### 6.4 Design tokens additions (one new primitive only)

Existing Bridge token system covers everything except the **curriculum-code chip**, which appears on every artifact. Single new primitive, semantic-color-keyed.

```css
/* curriculum-code chip — inherits from existing Bridge chip styles */
.cb-curriculum-chip {
  /* size: matches existing Bridge tag chip (token --chip-md) */
  /* color (light): --color-curriculum-bg (warm-ivory-tinted variant of --bridge-rust) */
  /* color (dark): --color-curriculum-bg-dark (matched to dark-mode rust palette) */
  /* type: --font-family-mono (tabular feel for codes like "B2.3") */
  /* contrast verified: ≥ 4.5:1 in both themes */
}
.cb-curriculum-chip--ministry { /* official Ministry code */ }
.cb-curriculum-chip--cb        { /* internal CB code (e.g., CB-G7-MATH-B2-SE3) */ }
.cb-curriculum-chip--inferred  { /* inferred via second-pass validator, not author-tagged */ }
```

### 6.5 Non-negotiable UX rules (from `ui-ux-pro-max` priority 1–2)

These apply to every new surface; reviewed at each stripe's `/pr-review` pass.

- **Accessibility (CRITICAL):** WCAG 4.5:1 contrast on every new surface; aria-labels on every icon-only button; screen-reader announcements on async state transitions (PENDING_REVIEW → APPROVED).
- **Touch & interaction (CRITICAL):** 44×44pt targets on all action buttons in the review queue and parent companion; loading feedback within 100ms of any tap; SSE streaming UI uses progressive content reveal (skeleton → token-by-token).
- **Reduced motion:** Voice-overlay typography scales with system text-size; SSE streaming respects `prefers-reduced-motion` (instant render instead of typewriter).
- **Color not the only indicator:** Curriculum chip variants (Ministry / CB / inferred) differ by **icon + label**, not color alone. Alignment-score badges differ by **shape + label**, not just red/yellow/green.

### 6.6 When to invoke `/bencium-innovative-ux-designer` and `/frontend-design`

Both skills are about distinctive production-grade UI. They overlap with `/ui-ux-pro-max`. To avoid overlap:

- Invoke `/ui-ux-pro-max` first on every UI stripe (covers patterns, tokens, accessibility, layout).
- Invoke `/bencium-innovative-ux-designer` **only** for the Board Admin Dashboard stripe (M3 batch 3h) — that surface has the most freedom for distinctive layouts (heatmaps, executive summaries, export flows).
- Invoke `/frontend-design` **only** for the Parent Companion render stripe (M1 batch 1f) — that surface is the brand-defining moment for parents and deserves distinctive visual treatment.

## 7. Batch plan — M0 through M5

Each batch is a coherent integration branch (`integrate/cb-cmcp-001-Mn-batch-Nx`) with **3–6 parallel stripes** that can ship in isolated worktrees. Per existing convention: 2× `/pr-review` per integration branch + lint+build+tests local before push.

### M0 — Foundation (target: June 2026)

Goal: CEG built and validated; cost model published; reviewer onboarded; M0 hard-gate decisions confirmed.

**Hard preconditions:** D1, D2, D3, D5, D7, D11 confirmed by user.

#### Batch M0-A — Schema + role extensions

| Stripe | Scope | Reuses |
|---|---|---|
| 0A-1 | DDL: `ceg_subjects`, `ceg_strands`, `ceg_expectations`, `curriculum_versions` (with `change_severity`) — pgvector ext if Postgres, fallback if SQLite (gate `if "sqlite" not in settings.database_url`) | phase-2 `CurriculumExpectation` model (extend) |
| 0A-2 | Extend `study_guides` per D2: add `se_codes` JSONB, `alignment_score`, `ceg_version`, `state`, `board_id`, `voice_module_hash`, `class_context_envelope_summary`, `requested_persona` | dev-03 `study_guide.py` |
| 0A-3 | Auth: add `BOARD_ADMIN` + `CURRICULUM_ADMIN` to `UserRole` enum; RBAC matrix updates | dev-03 `app/api/deps.py` |
| 0A-4 | Idempotent migrations in `main.py` startup using existing `pg_try_advisory_lock` pattern; advisory lock IDs reserved (e.g., 4351) | dev-03 main.py migration block pattern |

**Stripe count:** 4. Parallelizable. **Tests:** schema migration round-trip on PG + SQLite.

#### Batch M0-B — CEG extraction pipeline

| Stripe | Scope | Reuses |
|---|---|---|
| 0B-1 | Port phase-2 `app/api/routes/curriculum.py` REST API (read-only) under feature flag | phase-2 |
| 0B-2 | Two-pass extractor (D5=B): `cli/extract_ceg.py` — runs Claude twice with different prompts, diffs results, writes pending-review JSON | phase-2 `curriculum_seed.py` (pattern) |
| 0B-3 | Curriculum-Admin review interface: `/admin/ceg/review` — accept / reject / edit each extracted SE | New (dev-03 admin pattern) |
| 0B-4 | Embedding generation backfill job: `cli/embed_ceg.py` — `text-embedding-3-small` per expectation; pgvector index | phase-2 mapping service (pattern) |
| 0B-5 | Phase-1 seed run: Gr 1–8 Math, Lang, Sci, Soc Studies — store source PDFs in private GCS bucket; commit extracted JSON to repo for audit | New |

**Stripe count:** 5. **Tests:** extractor round-trip on a small sample; review-interface RBAC; embedding lookup match accuracy (≥95% on sample queries).

#### Batch M0-C — Quality SLA + reviewer onboarding (process, not code)

| Stripe | Scope |
|---|---|
| 0C-1 | Hire / contract paid OCT-certified curriculum reviewer (~80h Phase 1) — owner: founder, not engineering |
| 0C-2 | Accuracy audit framework: `cli/audit_ceg.py` — sample 100 SEs, compare to Ministry source, compute Ministry-code accuracy; ≥99% gate |
| 0C-3 | Publish CEG accuracy report on launch alongside the `ceg_versions.released_at` row |

**Stripe count:** 3. Mostly process; one CLI tool.

#### Batch M0-D — Cost model document

| Stripe | Scope |
|---|---|
| 0D-1 | Published doc: `docs/design/CB-CMCP-001-cost-model.md` — token cost per content type × pilot/single-board/multi-board volume tiers; $/artifact projection; CB-ASGF-001 baseline anchor |

**Stripe count:** 1. No code.

**M0 acceptance gate (unlocks M1):** CEG live (Gr 1–8, ≥99% Ministry-code accuracy audited); cost model published; reviewer onboarded; D1/D2/D3/D5/D7/D11 confirmed.

| 1D-3 | `alignment_score` written to artifact; if < 0.80 → `flag_for_review = True` | New |

**Stripe count:** 3. (Embedding-similarity validator deferred to M3 batch 3I per D4.)

#### Batch M1-E — Streaming UX (D6=B)

| Stripe | Scope | Reuses |

| 1F-3 | New Pydantic response with 5 fields; auto-emit on `state=APPROVED` for student-facing artifacts within 60s | New |
| 1F-4 | Frontend Parent Companion render: invoke `/frontend-design` skill for distinctive visual treatment of the 5 sections; uses Bridge tokens; warm coaching tone (NOT Arc-led) | New |
| 1F-5 | RBAC matrix update per A2 (FR-05 amendment) — STUDENT cannot access Parent Companion | dev-03 deps |

**Stripe count:** 5. **Acceptance:** every student-facing approved artifact has a Parent Companion derivative ≤60s; never includes answer key (auditable lint).

**M1 acceptance gate (unlocks M2):** Internal end-to-end generation works for all 5 content types + Parent Companion derivative; alignment validator hits ≥80% accuracy threshold; voice-overlay audit passes; ≥70% of test generations carry a populated class-context envelope.

---

| 2A-3 | New `BOARD_ADMIN` + `CURRICULUM_ADMIN` role wiring; RBAC matrix per DD §5.3 | New |

**Stripe count:** 3. **Note:** this also closes #2191 (or significantly de-scopes it).

#### Batch M2-B — CB-CMCP-001-specific MCP tools

| Stripe | Scope | Reuses |
|---|---|---|
| 2B-1 | `get_expectations` MCP tool — wraps the M0-B REST API | M1-A |

---

## 8. Rollout strategy

### 8.1 Feature flag ladder

Single root flag `cmcp.enabled` (default OFF) with variant gating:

```
off → internal_only → staff → on_5 → on_25 → on_100 → on_for_all
```

- **internal_only**: flagged users (engineering + curriculum admin)
- **staff**: ClassBridge employees
- **on_5 / 25 / 100**: percentage rollout to all users
- **on_for_all**: drop the flag; remove dead-code paths in next cleanup PR

### 8.2 Sub-flags

- `cmcp.board_mcp.enabled` — defaults OFF; flips ON only when a board signs DSA (per D1=C)
- `cmcp.parent_companion.enabled` — defaults OFF until M1-F lands + UX QA pass
- `cmcp.streaming.enabled` — defaults OFF until M1-E lands; allows fallback to sync if SSE issues arise

### 8.3 Telemetry per amendment

| Amendment | Metric | Target |
|---|---|---|
| A1 | % of generations with envelope_size > 0 | ≥70% by M3 |
| A1 | Cited_source_count per artifact | ≥1 average |
| A2 | Parent Companion adoption (DCI/Digest open + click) | ≥30% in 7d |
| A2 | Parent Companion render correctness (no answer key leak) | 100% |
| A3 | Voice module hash present on student-facing | 100% |
| A3 | Voice consistency audit (sample 50) | ≥90% inter-rater |
| A4 | Approved artifacts surfaced in DCI within 24h | ≥80% |
| A4 | Bridge entry CTR | ≥15% |
| A4 | Digest summary block render rate | ≥95% |

### 8.4 Kill-switch

If `cmcp.enabled` is flipped OFF mid-ramp, all generation requests fall back to existing CB-ASGF-001 / Tutor flows (no curriculum-aligned generation). Approved artifacts already in `study_guides` continue to render with their captured `voice_module_hash` + `ceg_version` — no regression.

---

## 9. Acceptance gates (cumulative)

| Gate | Unlocks | Required |
|---|---|---|
| **M0 → M1** | Generation pipeline build | CEG live (Gr 1–8, ≥99% accuracy); cost model published; reviewer onboarded; D1/D2/D3/D5/D7/D11 confirmed |
| **M1 → M2** | MCP server build | E2E generation works; alignment validator ≥80%; voice audit passes; envelope ≥70% on test corpus |
| **M2 → M3** | Workflow + surfaces | MCP live on Cloud Run; #2191 closed; internal QA pass |
| **M3 → M4** | Pilot opens | Teacher review functional; Bridge/DCI/Digest integration live; flag ramped to staff; A4 surface KPIs hit |
| **M4 → M5** | Phase 2 expansion | Pilot success criteria met; on_for_all ramp |

---

## 10. Risk register

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| CEG extraction misreads Ministry codes | Medium | High | D5=B two-pass + OCT reviewer + ≥99% accuracy gate |
| Class-context envelope leaks PII into prompts | Medium | High | A1 envelope structure scrubs at the resolver layer; PII linter on every envelope before injection |
| Parent Companion accidentally ships answer keys | Medium | High | Lint check on Parent Companion JSON; audit log; flag ON only after lint passes 100% on test corpus |
| Voice overlay drifts from CB-TUTOR-001 reference | Low | Medium | Weekly audit (M1-C-3) + voice version pinning per artifact |
| MCP server overwhelmed by board service accounts | Low | High | Per-client rate limit (300 req/min); Cloud Run autoscale max 20; alert on auth-failure spike |
| Board never signs DSA — CB-MCP value unrealized | Medium | High | D11 — interviews in parallel with M0; B2C value via Authenticity Layer is independent |
| Curriculum revision floods teacher re-review queue | Medium | Medium | D9=B severity classifier; only `scope_substantive` flags |
| Streaming SSE breaks for slow networks | Low | Medium | `cmcp.streaming.enabled` sub-flag; sync fallback for short artifacts |
| Cost overrun mid-M1 | Medium | Medium | D8=B cost model; per-artifact spend cap as backstop |
| User decides D2 differently mid-M0 | Low | High | Decide D2 BEFORE M0 batch 0a opens (hard precondition) |

---

## 11. Out of scope (deferred / explicitly not in CB-CMCP-001)

- IEP-specific differentiation (D10=B → separate Phase 2 epic with SEA/SERT/MFIPPA review)
- French-language curriculum (M5)
- Textbook / third-party content integration (future PRD)
- Student performance analytics beyond access logs (future PRD)
- Adaptive difficulty engine (future PRD; depends on student performance feedback loop)
- LTI 1.3 full launch (M3-E ships link-out stub only; full LTI = Phase 3)
- D2L Brightspace / Edsby native integration (Phase 3)
- Premium content packs / monetization (Phase 2)
- EQAO alignment (Phase 2)
- Multi-agent curriculum gap-filling orchestration (Phase 3)
